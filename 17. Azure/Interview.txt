Subscription and Resource Group in Azure
1. Azure Subscription
-> An Azure Subscription is a logical container that holds Azure resources (VMs, storage, databases, etc.).
-> It is the billing unit and management boundary for Azure resources.
-> It is linked to a billing account, and all resources under it share the same billing model.
-> A subscription can be associated with one or more Azure Active Directory (AD) tenants.

✔ Purpose:
-- Defines billing, quotas, and access control.
-- Contains multiple Resource Groups and resources.
-- Linked to an Azure AD Tenant.
-- Can have multiple subscriptions under a single account.

🔹 Example:
-- A company can have multiple subscriptions like:
-- Prod-Subscription (for production workloads)
-- Dev-Subscription (for development & testing)
-- Pay-as-you-go Subscription (for personal projects)

---------------------------------------------------------------
2. Azure Resource Group
-> A Resource Group is a logical container for Azure resources within a subscription.

✔ Purpose:
-- Organizes VMs, Storage, Networking, Databases, etc.
-- Helps manage RBAC, policies, and deployments.
-- Allows deletion of all resources at once by deleting the RG.
-- Resources in an RG must be in the same Azure region.

🔹 Example:
-- WebApp-RG → Contains a VM, an Azure SQL database, and a storage account for a web application.
-- AI-Project-RG → Contains GPU-based VMs and Azure Machine Learning resources.
-- Networking-RG → Contains VNets, NSGs, and Load Balancers.


***************************************************************************************
Q. What work u have done in Azure AD?
-> Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is Microsoft's cloud-based identity and access management (IAM) service.
-> Think of it as a Security Gatekeeper 🔐 for Your Cloud Resources.

** Key Features of Azure AD
✅ Single Sign-On (SSO) – One password for multiple apps (Azure, Office 365, GitHub, etc.).
✅ Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) – Extra security (password + OTP, fingerprint, etc.).
✅ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) – Assign specific permissions to users (e.g., Admin, Dev, Viewer).
✅ Identity Protection – Detects suspicious logins & blocks unauthorized access.
✅ Azure AD B2C – Lets external users (customers) log in to your apps using Google, Facebook, etc.
✅ Azure AD B2B – Securely share access with partners & vendors.

** How It Works (Simple Flow)
1️⃣ A user tries to log in to an Azure service or app.
2️⃣ Azure AD checks their identity (Username, Password, MFA).
3️⃣ If valid, Azure AD grants access based on assigned permissions.
4️⃣ If suspicious, Azure AD can block access or ask for extra verification (MFA).

***************************************************************************************
Q. Azure Identity and Access Control: Users, Groups, Managed Identities, and Service Principals
-> Azure Identity and Access Control is managed through Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). It ensures that only authorized users, apps, and services can access Azure resources.

IAM Policy		RBAC Role Assignment	Granting permissions to users & groups
Custom IAM Policy	Azure Custom Role	Fine-grained access control
IAM AssumeRole		Privileged Identity Management (PIM)	Temporary elevated permissions

1️⃣ Users 👤
-> A User is an individual with an Azure AD account. 
-> Users can log in and access resources based on their assigned roles and permissions.
-> Credentials: Users have username/password combinations or other forms of authentication (MFA).
-> Role: Users can be assigned roles for access control (e.g., Admin, Contributor).
-> Authentication: Users can authenticate through Azure AD for Single Sign-On (SSO) to multiple Azure services.

🔹 Types of Users:
✅ Cloud-Only Users – Created directly in Azure AD (e.g., user@contoso.onmicrosoft.com).
✅ Synced Users – Imported from an on-premises Active Directory via Azure AD Connect.
✅ Guest Users – External users (e.g., partners, vendors) who access Azure resources via B2B collaboration.

🔹 Example:
A company employee logs into Azure Portal, Office 365, or Teams using their Azure AD credentials.

$$ az ad user create --display-name "John Doe" --user-principal-name johndoe@contoso.com --password "StrongP@ssword!"

-------------------------------------------------------------------
2️⃣ Groups 👥
-> A Group is a collection of users that helps simplify access management.

🔹 Types of Groups:
✅ Security Groups – Used for access control (e.g., "Developers Group" with VM access).
✅ Microsoft 365 Groups – Used for collaboration (Teams, Outlook, SharePoint).
✅ Dynamic Groups: Membership can be automated based on user attributes (e.g., users in a specific location or department).

🔹 Why Use Groups?
-> Instead of assigning permissions individually, assign them to a group (e.g., all developers get access to Dev resources).
-> Users added to the group automatically inherit permissions.

-> Command to Create a Group (Azure CLI):
$$ az ad group create --display-name "DevOps Team" --mail-nickname "devops-team"

------------------------------------------------------------------------
3️⃣ Managed Identities 🔑
-> A Managed Identity is an Azure feature that provides an automatically managed identity for applications, services, or virtual machines (VMs) to use when connecting to other Azure services securely. 
-> It eliminates the need to store credentials, such as secrets or API keys, in code or configuration files.

🔹 Types of Managed Identities:
✅ System-Assigned MI – Tied to a single resource (e.g., a VM). Gets deleted when the resource is deleted.

✅ User-Assigned MI – Standalone identity that can be "Shared across multiple resources".

🔹 Why Use Managed Identities?
-- No need to store passwords/secrets in code.
-- Azure automatically rotates credentials for security.
-- Works seamlessly with Azure services (e.g., Key Vault, Storage, Databases).

-> Command to Create a System-Assigned Managed Identity (Azure CLI):
$$ az vm identity assign --resource-group myRG --name myVM
-> Command to Create a User-Assigned Managed Identity (Azure CLI):
$$ az identity create --name MyIdentity --resource-group myRG

-----------------------------------------------------------------
4️⃣ Service Principals 🤖
-> A Service Principal is an identity used by applications, scripts, and automation tools to access Azure resources securely.

🔹 Why Use Service Principals?
✅ Avoids using personal accounts in automation scripts.
✅ Can be granted specific permissions (Least Privilege Access).
✅ Supports role-based access control (RBAC).

🔹 Example Use Cases:
-- A CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, Jenkins) needs access to deploy to Azure.
-- A script automates resource creation without exposing credentials.

-> Command to Create a Service Principal (Azure CLI):
$$ az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "myApp" --role Contributor --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription-id}

📌 Authentication Methods
1️⃣ Using a Service Principal with a Client Secret (Most Common)
GitHub Actions → Store in GitHub Secrets (AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET).

Azure DevOps → Store in Pipeline Variables ($(AZURE_CLIENT_ID), $(AZURE_TENANT_ID), $(AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET)).


1️⃣ Client Secret (Password-Based Authentication)
2️⃣ Certificate-Based Authentication
3️⃣ Managed Identity Authentication (Recommended): Works only in Azure-hosted environments like VMs, Functions, AKS, etc.

***************************************************************************************
Azure Key Vault🔐
-----------------
-> Key Vault is more than just a secrets manager; it does secrets management, key management, and certificate management. 
-> It's more of a key management solution in Azure.

👉 Think of it as a Secure Digital Locker 🔒 for passwords, API keys, certificates, and encryption keys.

** Why Use Azure Key Vault? 🤔
✅ Secure Storage – Keeps sensitive information safe.
✅ Access Control – Only authorized apps and users can access secrets.
✅ Automated Secret Rotation – Automatically updates secrets & keys.
✅ Integration with Azure Services – Works with Azure Functions, VMs, Kubernetes, etc.
✅ Centralized Management – Manage all your secrets in one place.

Q. What Can Be Stored in Key Vault? 📦
🔹 Secrets – Sensitive data (API keys, passwords, database connection strings)
🔹 Keys – Cryptographic keys (RSA keys, encryption keys for data protection)
🔹 Certificates – SSL/TLS certificates (Secure website & app communications)

Q. How Does It Work? 🔄
1️⃣ Create a Key Vault in Azure.
2️⃣ Store secrets, keys, and certificates inside it.
3️⃣ Grant access to specific users, apps, or services using Managed Identities or Service Principals.
4️⃣ Use the secrets securely in your applications without exposing them in code.

How to Use Azure Key Vault? (Simple Steps)
1️⃣ Create a Key Vault
$$ az keyvault create --name MyKeyVault --resource-group MyRG --location eastus

2️⃣ Store a Secret
$$ az keyvault secret set --vault-name MyKeyVault --name "DBPassword" --value "SuperSecretP@ss"

3️⃣ Retrieve a Secret
$$ az keyvault secret show --vault-name MyKeyVault --name "DBPassword"


Q. Accessing Azure Key Vault Securely 🔑
🔹 With Managed Identities (Recommended) – Azure services (like VMs, Functions) can access secrets without storing credentials.
🔹 With Service Principals – Apps and CI/CD tools (GitHub Actions, Terraform) can authenticate securely.
🔹 With RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) – Grant specific permissions to users & apps

***************************************************************************************
1️⃣ Azure Virtual Machine (VM) Networking🌐
=======================================
-> Azure VM Networking is essential for communication, security, and connectivity between VMs, on-premises networks, and external services. 
-> It ensures secure and reliable data transfer between VMs and other services.

-- Key Features of VNets
✅ Isolated Environment → Secure and private network for resources.
✅ Subnets → Logical segmentation within a VNet.
✅ Peering → Connects multiple VNets.
✅ VPN & ExpressRoute → Secure on-premises connectivity.
✅ Load Balancing & Firewall Integration → Traffic distribution & security.

2️⃣ Key Networking Components in Azure VMs ⚙️
🔹 Virtual Network (VNet) – Private network for VMs (Connects VMs securely)
🔹 Subnet – Divides a VNet into smaller networks (Isolates resources like Web, Database)
🔹 Public IP Address – Allows external internet access (Hosts websites, remote access)
🔹 Private IP Address – Internal VM communication (VM-to-VM communication)
🔹 Network Security Group (NSG) – Firewall for controlling traffic (Allows/blocks internet access)
🔹 Azure Load Balancer – Distributes traffic between VMs (Ensures high availability)
🔹 VPN Gateway – Secure connection to on-premises (Hybrid cloud setups)
🔹 Azure Bastion – Secure remote VM access without Public IP (SSH/RDP without exposing IP)

$$ az network vnet create --name myVNet --resource-group myRG --address-prefix 10.0.0.0/16

3️⃣ How Azure VM Networking Works? 🔄
1️⃣ Create a Virtual Network (VNet) → Defines private network space.
2️⃣ Create Subnets → Divides the network into sections (e.g., Web, Database).
3️⃣ Assign IP Addresses → Public IP for internet, Private IP for internal use.
4️⃣ Apply NSGs → Controls which traffic is allowed/blocked.
5️⃣ Use Load Balancer → Spreads traffic across multiple VMs.


2. Subnets – Dividing the VNet
-> A Subnet is a smaller IP range within a VNet that helps segregate resources.

-- Best Practices for Subnets
✅ Separate Workloads → Example: Web, App, DB subnets.
✅ Use Network Security Groups (NSGs) → Restrict access per subnet.
✅ Plan Address Ranges Properly → Avoid IP conflicts.


3️⃣ Network Security Groups (NSG) – Firewall for VM Traffic
-> An NSG is a firewall-like rule set that controls inbound and outbound traffic for subnets or VMs.
Rule		Protocol	Port	Source	Destination	Action
Allow HTTP	TCP		80	Any	VM		Allow
Allow SSH	TCP		22	My IP	VM		Allow
Deny All	All		All	Any	Any		Deny
✅ Allow SSH (Port 22) from your office IP.
✅ Allow HTTP (Port 80) for web access.
❌ Deny all other internet access to secure VMs.


4️⃣ Public vs. Private IP Addresses 🌍
🔹 Public IP – Allows VMs to be accessed from the internet.
🔹 Private IP – Used for internal communication (VM-to-VM, Database connections).
-> Example:
-- A web server VM needs a Public IP to be accessible to users.
-- A database VM should only have a Private IP for security.

5️⃣ Load Balancers – Distributing Traffic
-> Azure Load Balancers distribute traffic evenly across multiple VMs.
🔹 Azure Load Balancer – Distributes traffic across VMs (Web apps, APIs)
🔹 Application Gateway – Load balances based on URLs (Directs traffic to different web services)
🔹 Traffic Manager – Routes traffic across regions (Multi-region apps)

6️⃣ Load Balancing & High Availability ⚖️
1. Public Load Balancer: Distributes traffic from the internet to VMs.
2. Internal Load Balancer: Distributes traffic within the private network.

7️⃣ Secure VM Access with Azure Bastion 🔐
-> Azure Bastion provides secure SSH/RDP access to VMs without exposing public IPs.
✅ Eliminates security risks from exposed RDP/SSH ports.
✅ Fully managed by Azure, no additional VMs needed.

8️⃣ Hybrid Networking (On-Premises to Azure) 🔗
🔹 VPN Gateway – Secure connection between on-premises and Azure.
🔹 ExpressRoute – Dedicated high-speed private connection.
🔹 VNet Peering – Connects multiple VNets across regions.

***************************************************************************************
Q. terraform backend blob storage, state file
1. Configuring Terraform Backend with Azure Blob Storage
-- resource_group_name → The resource group where the storage account exists.
-- storage_account_name → The Azure Storage Account name.
-- container_name → The Azure Storage Container to store the state file.
-- key → The path inside the container where the state file will be stored.

terraform {
  backend "azurerm" {
    resource_group_name   = "terraform-state-rg"
    storage_account_name  = "terraformstateaccount"
    container_name        = "tfstate"
    key                   = "prod/terraform.tfstate"
  }
}

🔹 No need for dynamodb_table, encrypt, or acl in Azure—it’s handled natively.
🔹 Azure Blob Lease Mechanism prevents simultaneous updates.
🔹 RBAC and Storage Encryption ensure security.
🔹 Use workspaces or environment-based keys for separate state files.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. how do you partition state file, diff env and diff state files in workspace,  modules to keep and use, workspace, separate application we are using workspace?
1. Partitioning State Files in Azure Blob Storage Backend
-> When using Terraform with Azure Blob Storage as the backend, partitioning state files is essential for managing multiple environments, teams, and projects efficiently.

1️⃣ Why Partition State Files? 🤔
✔ Isolation – Keeps different environments (dev, test, prod) separate.
✔ Concurrency – Avoids conflicts when multiple teams work on the same infrastructure.
✔ Security – Limits access based on role-based permissions.
✔ Scalability – Helps manage large infrastructures without file conflicts.

Option 1: Using Workspaces for Environment-Based Partitioning
Modify your backend "azurerm" block:
terraform {
  backend "azurerm" {
    resource_group_name   = "terraform-state-rg"
    storage_account_name  = "terraformstateaccount"
    container_name        = "tfstate"
    key                   = "envs/${terraform.workspace}/terraform.tfstate"
  }
}
terraform workspace new dev
terraform workspace new prod
terraform workspace select dev
terraform apply


Option 2: Separate Applications Using Workspaces
If you are deploying multiple applications (e.g., app1, app2), you can structure the key dynamically to maintain different state files per application:
terraform {
  backend "azurerm" {
    resource_group_name   = "terraform-state-rg"
    storage_account_name  = "terraformstateaccount"
    container_name        = "tfstate"
    key                   = "apps/${var.app_name}/${terraform.workspace}/terraform.tfstate"
  }
}
State File Paths Example:
apps/app1/dev/terraform.tfstate
apps/app1/prod/terraform.tfstate
apps/app2/dev/terraform.tfstate
apps/app2/prod/terraform.tfstate

2️⃣ Securing State Files 🔐
🔹 Enable Azure RBAC – Restrict access (read/write) based on roles.
🔹 Enable Soft Delete – Allows restoring accidentally deleted state files.
🔹 Enable Versioning – Keeps track of changes in the state files.
🔹 Enable Blob Locks – Prevents unintended deletions/modifications.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Using Modules for Reusability
-> Using modules helps to keep Terraform code organized and reusable across applications and environments.
Example: Creating a Network Module
1️⃣ Create a module inside modules/network/main.tf
resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "vnet" {
  name                = var.vnet_name
  location            = var.location
  resource_group_name = var.resource_group_name
  address_space       = var.address_space
}

2️⃣ Define Variables (modules/network/variables.tf)
module "network" {
  source              = "../modules/network"
  vnet_name           = "${var.app_name}-vnet"
  location            = var.location
  resource_group_name = "${var.app_name}-rg"
  address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
}

Advantages of Using Modules
✅ Reusability → The same module can be used for different environments.
✅ Separation of Concerns → Each module manages a single infrastructure component.
✅ Easier Maintenance → Modify modules without affecting the entire infrastructure.


******************************************************************************************
✅ Storing Terraform Modules in Repos
-> Modules can be stored in:

✅ Calling Modules in main.tf (Environment-Specific)
-> Each environment (e.g., dev/main.tf) should call the modules.
module "network" {
  source              = "../modules/network"
  vnet_name           = "${var.app_name}-vnet"
  location            = var.location
  resource_group_name = var.resource_group_name
  address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
}
-- This keeps the code DRY and reusable.
-- Different environments (e.g., dev, prod) can override values via terraform.tfvars.

module "network" {
  source  = "../modules/network"
  source  = "github.com/example-org/network-module.git"  [Using a GitHub-hosted Module] 
  source  = "terraform-azure-modules/storage/azurerm"    [Using Terraform Registry]

Q. Complete Terraform project structure demonstrating how to manage the backend, resource modules, and variable structure.
Q. Breaking Infrastructure into Separate Terraform Modules
-> When designing Terraform modules, the goal is reusability, maintainability, and separation of concerns. Below is a structured approach to breaking down a complete infrastructure into separate modules.

1️⃣ High-Level Infrastructure Breakdown
Let's say you have the following infrastructure:
✅ Virtual Network (VNet)
✅ Subnets (Public, Private)
✅ Virtual Machines (VMs)
✅ Security Groups & NSGs
✅ Storage

========================================================================
3️⃣ Calling the Modules in environments/dev/main.tf
Now, in environments/dev/main.tf, call the modules.

module "network" {
  source              = "../../modules/network"
  vnet_name           = "dev-vnet"
  location            = "East US"
  resource_group_name = "dev-rg"
  address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
  public_subnet_cidr  = ["10.0.1.0/24"]
  private_subnet_cidr = ["10.0.2.0/24"]
}

module "compute" {
  source              = "../../modules/compute"
  vm_name             = "dev-vm"
  location            = "East US"

  source              = "../../modules/security"
  nsg_name            = "dev-nsg"
  location            = "East US"
  resource_group_name = "dev-rg"
}


***************************************************************************************
Azure Load Balancer 🌐
======================
✅ Need to load balance VMs in one region? → Use Azure Load Balancer
✅ Need path-based routing for web apps? → Use Application Gateway
✅ Need global DNS-based traffic management? → Use Traffic Manager
✅ Need global performance and security? → Use Azure Front Door


1️⃣ Application Gateway 🏗️
🔹 Purpose: Intelligent traffic routing based on URL paths, host headers.
🔹 Works at: Layer 7 (Application Layer - HTTP/HTTPS)
🔹 Best For:
✔️ Web applications requiring path-based routing.
✔️ SSL termination to offload encryption work.
✔️ Protecting web apps using Web Application Firewall (WAF).

🔹 Example Use Cases:
✅ Route traffic to /login to one backend and /dashboard to another.
✅ Host multiple apps under one domain (e.g., app1.company.com, app2.company.com).


2️⃣ Front Door 🚦
🔹 Purpose: Global application acceleration, routing, and security.
🔹 Works at: Layer 7 (Application Layer - HTTP/HTTPS)
🔹 Best For:
✔️ Global load balancing for web applications.
✔️ Content delivery acceleration with built-in caching.
✔️ Security – Protect apps from DDoS attacks.

🔹 Example Use Cases:
✅ A web application hosted in multiple Azure regions needs fast global access.
✅ Automatically failover traffic if one region goes down.


 3️⃣ Azure Load Balancer 🌐
-> Azure offers different types of load balancers to distribute traffic efficiently across resources like Virtual Machines (VMs), Web Apps, and services.

🔹 Purpose: Distributes traffic across VMs in a single region.
🔹 Works at: Layer 4 (Transport Layer - TCP/UDP)
🔹 Best For:
✔️ Web applications, APIs, and backend services.
✔️ High availability for Virtual Machines (VMs).
✔️ Internal or external traffic distribution.

🔹 Example Use Cases:
✅ Load balancing requests between multiple web servers (VMs).
✅ Distributing incoming internet traffic to application servers.


4️⃣ Traffic Manager 🌍
🔹 Purpose: Global DNS-based traffic distribution across multiple regions.
🔹 Works at: DNS Level (Does not actually load balance network traffic)
🔹 Best For:
✔️ Multi-region deployments (Distributes users to the nearest region).
✔️ Disaster recovery (Redirects traffic if one region goes down).
✔️ Weighted routing (Send 70% traffic to one region and 30% to another).

🔹 Example Use Cases:
✅ A global app with users in the US, Europe, and Asia—Traffic Manager routes them to the closest datacenter.
✅ If a datacenter fails, Traffic Manager redirects traffic to the backup region.
