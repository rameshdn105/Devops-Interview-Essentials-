web application:

-> Users-webserver(appn can be developed in: php, asp net, java, note js)- accessed by ip adress initially-
   rational data base (all apn data stored),( SQL. oracle, my sql,) {Azure sql database}
-> Private network or on premise network {virtual pvt network}

3tier architecutre: 

One traffic increases below structure is used: {servers-virtual machines}
Web server(Disc)-(Angular, html/css)
App server(Disc)-web api
RDMBS (SQL server/oracle) (DB)

After again increase in traffic we will use scaling.{autoscaling}
Horizontal scaling: add new servers{VM's}
Vertical scaling:  CPU memory, storage capacity

What traffic should go which server load balancer {Azure load bal} wil do.
Domain name will be provided for user to contact application.{DNS}

But to build high traffic complex application we need more services:
But we cant keep everything in shown data bases as lot of images, videos will be circulating in fb its not a good idea to save all in same servers,
so we need external storage which will keep all videos, sometimes videos contains objectionable or nude videos 
   to filter them we add content filter. {Computer vision/Cognitive services}

-> messages, likes and comments this data will be so big that our rational SQL wll not be able to handle it.
so we need NoSQL will be used like MongoDB.

-> Click stream analysis: all clicks and likes will be stored in some storages and analysed in Hadoop (Big data analysis platform) and 
   this big data will be stored in Datawarehouse, with help of business decisions will be taken by business intelligence.
-> by using it they can lunch a new product, launch graphs maps for business analytics.

-> Implications performance mode: images, videos can be shared in other web sites also for this direct for images and videos will be provided
   For mobile specifically we will be keeping external storage mobile, as these images will be rendered/displayed 
   differently from laptop. First these images will compressed, resized then it will be stored.
Why: they are big in size and take time to download.
-> Apply content delivery network(Azure CDN) in diff location around the world: 

-> Messaging queues/notifications (MSMQ) {Azure bus service}: helps msges deliver fast and efficiently.

-> Monitoring dashboard {Azure monitor}: keep checking health of all resources, server, database, storage in single dashboard. If any problem any one of them it will alarm.

Replacing all on premise with azure srvices:

Private network: Virtual network	(VPC:virtual private cloud)
Servers: Virtual  machines   (Instance)
disk storage: azure disk storage for caching, processing fequesntly requested data, limited size  (S3 bucket)
load balancer {Azure load bal}

autoscaling: based on traffic it will scale  (Horrizontal scaling: add new servers{VM's}, Vertical scaling:  CPU memory, storage capacity)
database: azure sql database, oracle, MySQL
Db cache: Radis cache
NoSQL: Cosomos DB,MongoDB
DNS: AZure DNS, FB.com to mapping to ip adres of servers

Click stream analysis: records all user activity or clicks of users stores in storage i.e., Blob storage/File storage:
Hadoop: Azure HD insight  (Big data analysis platform)
warehouse: Azuredata warehouse   (this big data will be stored)
Business intelligence: Azure synaps (Graphs then launching new product)
external Storage: Azure blob storage (Storing mages and videos) take help of computer visions for AI  
content filter: Computer vision/Cognitive services		(sometimes videos contains objectionable or nude videos to filter them we add content filter)
convert laptop specific images into mobile sized images: Functions (Serverless computing they do not any outsde involvement)
Content delivery network: Azure content delivery network.		(CDNs are commonly used for delivering high-bandwidth content such as video and audio streaming, large software downloads, and online gaming)

Messages notification services: Azure bus services		(helps msges deliver fast and efficiently)
Monitor: Azure monitor 		(keep checking health of all resouces, server, database, storage in single dashboard. If any problem any one of them it will alarm.)
Azure DDoS Protection: type of cyberattack that aims to make a website or online service unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources
Azure active directory: Authentication and Authorization
Azure key vault: securely storing and accesing secrets, all info stored will be in encrypted form.
App Service certificate: Now we want our application is accessed by https not http as https is more secure.
* Web application Firewall(WAF): monitor and restrict incoming and outgoing traffic.
* Security center: to make sure all resoures in virtual network are virus free and software compliance
* Resource manager: Manage rsources, adding new load balancer
* CI/CD: depoying appn in one go without deploying each and every component saparately.


Some services which will do virtual network Secure:
Security:
Azure active directory: Authentiction and Authorization
-> identiy and access mnagement svc which helps developer, admin  to sign in and access all these resouces
-> what resource will be available to which developer will be decided by those service.

Azure key vault: securely storing and accesing secrets, all info stored will be in encrypted form.
-> Ex:database is conection is stored in ths keyvault.

* App Service certificate: Now we want our application is accessed by https not http as https is more secure.
* Web application Firewall(WAF): monitor and restrict incoming and outgoing traffic.
* Security center: to make sure all resoures in virtual network are virus free and software compliance
* Resource manager: Manage rsources, adding new load balancer
* CI/CD: depoying appn in one go without deploying each and every component saparately.
