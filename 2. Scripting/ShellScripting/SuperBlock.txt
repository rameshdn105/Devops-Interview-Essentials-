Superblock:
-> In Shell (sh, bash, etc.), the term superblock usually refers to the filesystem metadata structure used in Linux and UNIX-based systems. The superblock contains essential information about the filesystem, such as its size, block size, free blocks, and inode information.

Viewing the Superblock in Shell:
-------------------------------
df -ht   :will give all the file syste with detaiuled info
sudo dumpe2fs /dev/sdX: all infor about all metadata of filesyatem "/dev/sdX"
sudo tune2fs -l /dev/sdX: all detailed infor about all metadata of filesyatem "/dev/sdX"


-> You can use commands like dumpe2fs, tune2fs, or debugfs to inspect the superblock on an ext filesystem.

1. Check the Superblock with dumpe2fs
$$ sudo dumpe2fs /dev/sdX | grep -i superblock

2. View Superblock with tune2fs
$$ sudo tune2fs -l /dev/sdX | grep -i superblock

3. Using debugfs to Inspect the Superblock
$$ sudo debugfs /dev/sdX
-- Then, inside debugfs, run:
$$ stats


Recovering a Corrupt Superblock:
================================
-> If the primary superblock is damaged, you can restore it from a backup superblock. Run:
$$ sudo fsck.ext4 -b <backup_superblock> /dev/sdX

-> To find backup superblocks, use:
$$ sudo mke2fs -n /dev/sdX
