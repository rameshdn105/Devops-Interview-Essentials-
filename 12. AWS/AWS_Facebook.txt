Web Application Architecture:
Users Web Server (Appn can be developed in PHP, ASP.NET, Java, Node.js): This can be deployed on Amazon EC2 instances or AWS Elastic Beanstalk (Platform-as-a-Service for easy web app deployment).

Rational Database (SQL databases like Azure SQL Database):

Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) to handle SQL databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, and SQL Server.
Private Network / On-Premise Network (Azure Virtual Network equivalent):

Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) â€“ Isolated network for your AWS resources.
3-Tier Architecture:
Web Server:

EC2 instances running web applications (Angular, HTML/CSS).
App Server:

EC2 instances running APIs or backend logic (such as Node.js, Java, or .NET APIs).
RDBMS (SQL Server, Oracle) Database:

Amazon RDS for managing relational databases, such as SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.
Scaling:
Horizontal Scaling (Add new servers):
Auto Scaling Groups: Automatically add or remove EC2 instances based on traffic or load.
Vertical Scaling (Increase CPU, Memory, Storage):
Modify EC2 instance types to scale vertically (e.g., change instance type to a larger one).
For RDS, Amazon Aurora, or DynamoDB, you can modify instance types or storage.
Load Balancer:
AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB): Distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances.
DNS:
Amazon Route 53: Provides domain name system (DNS) services, for mapping domain names (e.g., facebook.com) to the corresponding IP addresses of servers.
External Storage for Large Files (Images, Videos):
Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service): Store and serve large files like videos, images, etc.
AWS Lambda (Serverless compute) to trigger functions (e.g., image resizing, content filtering, etc.).
Content Filtering (AI for Filtering Objectionable Content):
Amazon Rekognition: AWS service to detect inappropriate or unwanted content in images and videos.
NoSQL Database for Big Data (Likes, Comments, etc.):
Amazon DynamoDB: Managed NoSQL database for scalable and low-latency operations, perfect for high-velocity data like likes, comments, etc.
Clickstream Analysis and Big Data Processing:
Clickstream Data Storage:
Amazon S3 for storing raw clickstream data.
Big Data Analysis:
Amazon EMR (Elastic MapReduce) for Hadoop-based big data analysis.
Data Warehouse:
Amazon Redshift for storing and querying large amounts of data in a data warehouse.
Business Intelligence:
Amazon QuickSight: Business Intelligence (BI) service to create interactive visualizations and reports from your data.
Image Resizing for Mobile Devices:
AWS Lambda: Serverless function to resize images for mobile devices (e.g., compress and resize large images before serving them).
Content Delivery Network (CDN):
Amazon CloudFront: Global CDN to deliver low-latency content (images, videos, etc.) to users across the world.
Messaging Queue for Fast Notifications:
Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service): Asynchronous message queue service for decoupling components and handling fast messaging/notification delivery.
Monitoring & Health Check:
Amazon CloudWatch: Monitors the health of all AWS resources (EC2, RDS, Lambda, etc.) in real time.

AWS CloudTrail: Tracks API calls and user activity across the AWS environment.

Security & Networking:
Virtual Network:

Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): Creates isolated networks for security and privacy.
Authentication & Authorization:

AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management): Manages user access and permissions for AWS resources.
Amazon Cognito: Provides authentication and authorization for mobile/web applications.
Key Management and Secret Storage:

AWS KMS (Key Management Service): Manages and encrypts keys for your application.
AWS Secrets Manager: Stores and retrieves database credentials, API keys, and other secrets.
Web Application Firewall (WAF):

AWS WAF: Protects your web applications from common web exploits and attacks.
Threat Protection:

AWS Shield: Provides DDoS protection.
Amazon GuardDuty: Continuous security monitoring for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior.
Server and Data Protection:

AWS Security Hub: Comprehensive view of security alerts and compliance status across AWS accounts.
AWS Inspector: Security assessment service to help improve security and compliance of applications.
Resource Manager:

AWS CloudFormation: Manages AWS resources using infrastructure-as-code.
AWS Elastic Beanstalk: Simplified service for deploying and managing applications.
CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment):

AWS CodePipeline: Automates build, test, and deploy stages for applications.
AWS CodeBuild: Fully managed build service.
AWS CodeDeploy: Automates deployment to EC2 instances or Lambda.
