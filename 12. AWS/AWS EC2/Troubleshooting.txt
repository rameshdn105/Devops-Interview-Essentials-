** We have created Loadbalancer and attached to a target group which had 2 instances with nginx installed.

But when we try to acces them using load balancer DNS, we were getting "502 BAD GATEWAY" error.

When we connected one of EC2 and try to access server:
curl http://localhost:80
curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 80 after 0 ms: Couldn't connect to server

-> It means something is wrong with NGINX or port 80 isn't listening properly. Let's troubleshoot step by step to resolve this. 🚀

✅ Step-by-Step Troubleshooting for NGINX Not Listening on Port 80

1. ✅ Check if NGINX is Installed
$$ nginx -v

-> If NGINX is installed, this will show the version (e.g., nginx version: nginx/1.18.0).
-> ❌ If command not found, NGINX is not installed — install it first:

Amazon Linux 2:
sudo amazon-linux-extras enable nginx1
sudo yum install -y nginx


2. ✅ Check if NGINX Service is Running
$$ sudo systemctl status nginx
- If active (running) → good.
- If inactive or failed:

sudo systemctl status nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
sudo systemctl status nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl status nginx
curl http://localhost:80


3. ✅ Check if NGINX is Listening on Port 80
$$ sudo netstat -tulnp | grep 80
or 
$$ sudo ss -tulnp | grep 80

-> You should see something like:
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:80            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      <nginx-pid>/nginx
❌ If no output, NGINX is not listening — check configuration next.


4. ✅ Check NGINX Configuration for Port 80
$$ sudo cat /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
-> ➡️ You should see a listen 80; directive:

5. ✅ Test NGINX Configuration Syntax
Check if NGINX config is valid:
$$ sudo nginx -t

-> If successful, you will see:
nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful


6. ✅ Reload or Restart NGINX
$$ sudo systemctl restart nginx

7. ✅ Firewall & Security Group Check (if accessing externally)



✅ Quick Checklist Summary:
Checkpoint	                 Command / What to Do
Is NGINX installed?	            nginx -v
Is NGINX running?	            sudo systemctl status nginx
Is NGINX listening on port 80?	`sudo netstat -tulnp
Is configuration correct (listen 80)?	Check /etc/nginx/nginx.conf or site configs
Is configuration valid?	        sudo nginx -t
Restart NGINX	                sudo systemctl restart nginx
Security Group allows port 80?	Check EC2 Security Group (AWS Console)
Firewall on instance allows port 80?	sudo iptables -L or sudo ufw status (Ubuntu)
