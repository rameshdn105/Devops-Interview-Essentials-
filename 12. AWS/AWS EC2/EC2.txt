EC2 Placement Groups in AWS
EC2 Placement Groups help optimize the placement of instances for low latency, high throughput, or fault tolerance. AWS provides different placement strategies based on workload requirements.

Types of EC2 Placement Groups:
Cluster Placement Group

Instances are placed close together in a single Availability Zone (AZ).
Used for low-latency, high-bandwidth applications (e.g., HPC, big data, ML workloads).
Best for: Workloads requiring high network performance.
Risk: If the AZ fails, all instances may be impacted.
Spread Placement Group

Instances are placed across multiple hardware racks in different AZs.
Provides high availability and fault tolerance (max 7 instances per AZ).
Best for: Critical applications requiring isolation (e.g., database nodes, HA services).
Risk: Higher latency compared to Cluster Placement Groups.
Partition Placement Group

Instances are divided into partitions across multiple AZs (up to 7 partitions).
Each partition runs on separate racks with dedicated networking and power.
Best for: Large-scale distributed applications like Hadoop, Kafka, Cassandra.
Risk: If a single partition fails, other partitions remain unaffected.
Key Considerations:
Cluster PG: High-speed networking (10 Gbps+).
Spread PG: Good for fault tolerance, but limited to 7 instances per AZ.
Partition PG: Best for large distributed applications.
Cannot move instances between placement groups; must be stopped and relaunched.
