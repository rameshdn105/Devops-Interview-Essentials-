you can use tfvars file to override the default values for variables that you have defined inside variables.tf file

example:

 inside variables.tf

 variable "instance_type" {
    default = "t2.micro"
 }


inside  terraform.tfvars

instance_type = "t3.medium"


when you do a terraform plan or apply, terraform.tfavars will override the default value t2.micro


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

VERY IMP !!!!

you have to name the tfvars file as terraform.tfvars,

otherwise, you have to explicitly specify the tfvars file name


suppose you have named your tfvars file as custom.tfvars 

then you have to explicity specify the file name during terraform plan or apply 

>>>>>>>>>>>>    terraform plan -var-file="custom.tfvars"
