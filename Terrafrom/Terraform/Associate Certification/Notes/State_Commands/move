=== terraform state mv 

terraform state mv command is used to move items in a terraform state 

This command is used in many situation in which you want to rename a resource instead of destroying and recreating it.

example,

resource "aws_instance" "demo"{
    ami = "ami-0261755bbcb8c4a84"
    instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

suppose that you want to change the name of above resource from demo to webapp, 

    if you just try to edit the configuration and change the name from demo to webapp, the plan output will looks like the following,

    Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy.

    that means, it will destroy and recreate the resource

    ==>> in order to overcome that, you can use -> terraform state mv command 

    ==> terraform state mv command just rename the resource (it won't destroy it)

example:

    terraform state mv aws_instance.demo aws_instance.webapp



IMP NOTE: Once the state is moved, you should update the resource name manually in the terraform configuration, otherwise next terraform plan will be -> Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy.

coz, in code your resource will still be demo and in statefile -> webapp

so, once statefile is updated with the new resource name (ie, webapp in this case), yyou should change the resource name in the code

ie,

resource "aws_instance" "demo"{
    ami = "ami-0261755bbcb8c4a84"
    instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

should be changed to,

resource "aws_instance" "webapp"{
    ami = "ami-0261755bbcb8c4a84"
    instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
