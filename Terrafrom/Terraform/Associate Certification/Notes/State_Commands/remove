==> terraform state rm <resource name>

terraform state rm command is used to manually remove a resource from the statefile, but it will not be destroyed from the infra 
=> the resource will no longer be managed by terraform

here also, you should remove the terraform resource block from your terraform configuration, otherwise next terraform plan will show

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy
