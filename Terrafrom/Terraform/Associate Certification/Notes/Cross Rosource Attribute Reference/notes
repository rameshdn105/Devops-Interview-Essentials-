Each resource has it's own set of attributes associated to it.

NOTE: attributed get created only after the successful creation of the resource

    attributes examples:
                        arn, public_ip, private_ip, instance_id, private_dns etc..

                        all the above attributes will get created only after the resource is created

    
how to do cross reference 

 resource "aws_eip" "lb" {
    domain = "vpc"
}

resource "aws_security_group" "allow_tls" {
  name        = "allow_tls"
  description = "Allow TLS inbound traffic"
  
  ingress {
   
    from_port   = 443
    to_port     = 443
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = [aws_eip.lb.public_ip/32]   #/32 because it's expecting a cidr
  }

  egress {
    from_port       = 0
    to_port         = 0
    protocol        = "-1"
    cidr_blocks     = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    prefix_list_ids = ["pl-12c4e678"]
  }
}   

in the above code resource aws_eip.lb will be created first because aws_security_grouop.allow_tls is dependednt on it
