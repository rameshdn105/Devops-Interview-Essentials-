create a new workspace with cli-driven workflow option(NOTE: don't choose VCS. you can't use VCS with cli-driven flow)

here, terraform configuration needs to be in your local disk(you can keep the code on a seperate repo but yo can't connect the repo with Terraform cloud)

backend configuration

terraform {
  cloud {
    organization = "my-org"
    workspaces {
      tags = ["networking"]
    }
  }


IMP: YOU HAVE TO LOGIN TO TERRAFORM CLOUD FROM YOUR TERMINAL USING -> "TERRAFORM LOGIN" COMMAND

IT WILL OPEN A PROMT AND ALLOW YOU TO GENERATE A TOKEN AND COPY PASTE THAT TOKEN ON YOUR TERMINAL PROMPT 

terraform {
  cloud {
    organization = "Terraform_shyam"

    workspaces {
      name = "remote_backend"
    }
  }
}
