flatten takes a list and replaces any elements that are lists with a flattened sequence of the list contents.

> flatten([["a", "b"], [], ["c"]])
["a", "b", "c"]


If any of the nested lists also contain directly-nested lists, these too are flattened recursively:


> flatten([[["a", "b"], []], ["c"]])
["a", "b", "c"]
