If you don't specify a provider version, the most recent(latest) provider plugin will be downloaded 

what is the use of ~> symbol 

Version Number arguments

                >=1.0 -> greater than or equal to
                <=1.0 -> less than or equal to
                ~> 2.0  -> any version in the 2.X range 
                >=2.10,<=2.30 ge than equal to 2.10, less that or equal to 2.30

Dependency Lock file: Dependency lock file allows us to lock a specific version of provider 

if a particular version has been recorded in the lock file, terraform will always use the same version even if a new version is available

The output of a normal terraform init

        Initializing provider plugins...
        - Reusing previous version of integrations/github from the dependency lock file
        - Installing integrations/github v5.32.0...
        - Installed integrations/github v5.32.0 (signed by a HashiCorp partner, key ID 38027F80D7FD5FB2)
the above output clearly mention that the version is locked inside the dependency lock file (ie .terraform.lock.hcl)

How to upgrade the plugin then,

        you have to change the provider version in the code and then run the following command,

                    terraform init -upgrade 

NOTE:   if you simply change the provider version inside the code and try to run a terraform init command, you wil get the following error


            Error: Failed to query available provider packages

            Could not retrieve the list of available versions for provider
            integrations/github: locked provider registry.terraform.io/integrations/github
            5.32.0 does not match configured version constraint ~> 4.0; must use terraform
            init -upgrade to allow selection of new versions
