depending on the environment, it is recommended to avoid commiting certain files to git

Files to Ignore

> .terraform    -> This file will be created when terraform init is run(depends on the provider, it's very large in size)

> terraform.tfvars -> it may contain sesitive informations such as useranme/password

> terraform.tfstate -> it should be stored in the remote side, it can also contain sensitive data 

> crash.log     ->  if terraform crashes, the the logs are stored inside crash.log file 


you can add all the above files to .gitignore file, so that it will be ignored while pushing to github
