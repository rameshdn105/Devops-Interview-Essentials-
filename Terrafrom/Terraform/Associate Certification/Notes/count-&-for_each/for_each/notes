here index_key is refered as the elemet of the list (you can also check the statfile present in this folder)

example

"index_key": "t2.micro",

but in case of count - "index_key": 0,

"index_key": 2, etc...


so in case of count, if index value chnages, all the resources will be sometimes recreated or updated depends on the scenario
