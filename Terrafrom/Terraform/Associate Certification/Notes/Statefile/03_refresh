terraform refresh command will check the latest state of infrastructure and update the statefile  accordingly

suppose, if you delete an instance on aws manually and you need to delete the state of the instance from statefile, 
you can run terraform refresh command 


terraform refresh will not add or remove resources in the state file; it only updates the attributes of the existing 
resources in the state file to match the real-world state.

you can't use terraform refresh to import a resource to statefile

you can use terraform refresh only to update curerent infra with statefile, ie suppose you delete a resource manaually, you can 
run terraform refresh to update it in the statefile, however, if you create a resource manually, terraform refresh doesn't 
help you to update the statefile. in this case you have to run terraform import command 

note: terraform plan and apply by default do terraform refresh

commands:

terraform refresh

terraform apply -refresh-only
