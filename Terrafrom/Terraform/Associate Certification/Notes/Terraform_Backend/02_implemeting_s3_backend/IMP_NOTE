Initially i had provided the s3 location as -> statefiles and did a terraform apply

later, i have changed the s3 location to statafiles/terraform.tfstate , and i recived the below message 


shyamjith_sa@EPINCHEW00D1 02_implemeting_s3_backend % terraform init 

Initializing the backend...
Backend configuration changed!

Terraform has detected that the configuration specified for the backend
has changed. Terraform will now check for existing state in the backends.


Do you want to copy existing state to the new backend?
  Pre-existing state was found while migrating the previous "s3" backend to the
  newly configured "s3" backend. No existing state was found in the newly
  configured "s3" backend. Do you want to copy this state to the new "s3"
  backend? Enter "yes" to copy and "no" to start with an empty state.

  Enter a value: yes

  Since there was no infra change, the same(old) statefile got moved to the new location
