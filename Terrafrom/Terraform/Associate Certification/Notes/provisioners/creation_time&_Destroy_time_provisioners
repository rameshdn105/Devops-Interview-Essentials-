Creation time provisioner runs only during creation of the resource not during update or any other life cycle 

    if a creation time provisioner fails, the resource is marked as tainted 

    you can verify it by checking the statefile, the status will be marked as tainted 


destroy time provisioners are run before the resource is destroyed 


 resource "aws_instance" "demo"
    {
        ami = "dsdfcs"
        instance_type = t2.micros
        provisioners "local-exec" {
            when = destroy
            command = "echo ${aws_instance.demo.public_ip} >> publlic_ip.txt"
        }
    }
