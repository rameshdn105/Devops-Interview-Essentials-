from terraform 1.5 onwards, you can not only import statefile but also configuration for the particular resouce as well
    
    this can be done using import block

example 


import {
    to = aws_security_group.mysg
    id = "copy the resource id from aws"
}


then, 

run the terraform plan with -generate-config-out option
    
    example => terraform plan -generate-config-out=mysg.tf   ## configuration will be imported to mysg.tf file

to import the state file, you have to run the terraform apply command after running the terraform plan as mentioned in the above


-----

full steps 

1, terraform plan -generate-config-out=mysg.tf

2, terraform apply
