When you configure a function in Python, the value of the handler setting is the file name and the name of the handler module, separated by a dot. For example, main.Handler calls the Handler method defined in main.py.

How to deploy a lambda function that has multiple python files

example: a lambda function contains 2 python files "script1.py" and "script2.py"

the approach here is, you have to select those 2 files together and create a zip file(NOTE: don't create a folder and copy the 2 files and make a zip of the folder. i tried that but i didn't work)

demo: on mac long press on command key and select both the files and compress it 

        on windows long press ctrl and select 

upload the zip to s3

you can have same handler name on both the files
