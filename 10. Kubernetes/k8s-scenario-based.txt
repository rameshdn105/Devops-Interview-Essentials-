1. What happens if the k8s master node and worker node firewall gets broken?
-> Existing pods will continue running, but you can't deploy new workloads or updates. API server can't communicate with worker nodes, breaking cluster management capabilities.

2. What happens if etcd backup is corrupted during a cluster restore?
-> Complete cluster failure. The control plane won't initialize and you can't manage resources. Only options are using an older backup or rebuilding the cluster from scratch.

3. What happens if a node's kubelet crashes but the container runtime continues?
-> Existing pods keep running, but the node is marked "NotReady." After grace period (~5min), pods are evicted and rescheduled elsewhere. No new pods will be scheduled to this node.

4. How would applications behave if Kubernetes DNS (CoreDNS) fails?
-> Existing connections work but new service discovery fails. Applications show connection timeouts, and probes using DNS names fail, potentially causing cascading pod restarts.

5. What happens during a network partition between control plane and worker nodes?
-> Worker nodes continue running existing workloads, but controllers can't manage them. New deployments, scaling, and updates fail. Nodes might eventually be marked unreachable.

6. What happens if your CNI plugin starts dropping packets intermittently?
-> Pod-to-pod communication becomes unreliable with sporadic timeouts. Services appear down randomly, causing difficult-to-troubleshoot application failures and inconsistent behavior.

7. What happens to StatefulSets if underlying storage experiences high latency?
-> Pod startup times increase dramatically. Database pods may trigger restart loops, write operations timeout, and new pods get stuck in "ContainerCreating" state.

8. What happens if pod resource limits are set too low?
-> Containers face OOM kills during peak loads. Applications become unstable with unexpected restarts, and horizontal scaling can't solve the problem since each instance is resource-starved.

9. What happens when control plane can't reach cloud provider's API?
-> Cloud-specific features like LoadBalancers and persistent volumes fail. Node initialization is incomplete, and external resource provisioning stops working.

10. What happens if your cluster's certificate authority expires?
-> Complete cluster failure. All component communications fail with TLS errors. API server rejects connections, kubectl stops working, and the entire cluster becomes unusable.
