🚧 Enable API Server Admission Controllers
-> Use admission controllers to enforce security policies.
-> Recommended ones:
1. NodeRestriction
2. Pod Security
3. NamespaceLifecycle
4. AlwaysPullImages
5. DenyEscalatingExec

# Example API server flag
--enable-admission-plugins=NodeRestriction,PodSecurity,NamespaceLifecycle


🚀 What are Admission Controllers? [Admission Controllers: Should this request be allowed, modified, or rejected?]
-> Admission Controllers are plugins that intercept requests to the Kubernetes API after authentication and authorization, but before the object is persisted to etcd.
-> They validate, mutate, or deny requests based on custom logic or policies.
-> Admission Controllers help enforce security, compliance, and operational policies.

🛡️ Types of Admission Controllers
1. Mutating Admission Controllers
-- Modify requests before they are saved.
-- Example: Add default values like resource limits, labels, sidecar containers.

2. Validating Admission Controllers
-- Accept or reject requests based on cluster policies.
-- Example: Reject Pods running as root or without resource limits.

🔑 How Admission Controllers Work (Flow)
User → API Server → [Authentication] → [Authorization] → [Admission Controllers] → etcd


🛠️ How to Enable Admission Controllers
-> In kube-apiserver (control plane), set the --enable-admission-plugins flag:
$$ --enable-admission-plugins=NamespaceLifecycle,LimitRanger,ServiceAccount,NodeRestriction,PodSecurity,ResourceQuota

To disable some (if needed):
$$ --disable-admission-plugins=AlwaysAdmit,AlwaysPullImages

🌐 Webhook-based Admission Controllers
-> Kubernetes also supports "Dynamic admission controllers" via webhooks:
1. MutatingAdmissionWebhook — Modify resource spec (e.g., inject sidecars).
2. ValidatingAdmissionWebhook — Accept/reject based on custom validation logic (e.g., compliance rules).
-> Example use case: OPA (Open Policy Agent) as a Validating Webhook.

✅ Best Practices for Admission Controllers
1. Enable critical controllers like NamespaceLifecycle, ServiceAccount, PodSecurity, NodeRestriction.
2. Use MutatingAdmissionWebhook to inject standard configs (e.g., logging sidecars).
3. Use ValidatingAdmissionWebhook to enforce organizational policies.
4. Combine with RBAC and Network Policies for layered security.
5. Regularly audit and review policies enforced by controllers.


⚙️ Commonly Used Admission Controllers
Admission Controller	Type			Purpose
1. NamespaceLifecycle  ->  Validating  ->  Ensures namespace exists, handles namespace deletion.
2. LimitRanger  ->  Validating  ->  Enforces resource limits (CPU, memory).
3. ServiceAccount  ->  Mutating  ->  Automates service account management for Pods.
4. NodeRestriction  ->  Validating  ->  Limits kubelet actions (e.g., modifying pods).
5. PodSecurity  ->  Validating  ->  Enforces Pod Security Standards (restricted, baseline).
6. ResourceQuota  ->  Validating  ->  Enforces resource quotas per namespace.
7. DefaultStorageClass  ->  Mutating  ->  Assigns default StorageClass to PVCs.
8. MutatingAdmissionWebhook  ->  Mutating  ->  Allows custom external webhooks to mutate requests.
9. ValidatingAdmissionWebhook  ->  Validating  ->  Allows custom external webhooks to validate requests.

1. 🌐 What is NamespaceLifecycle?
-> The NamespaceLifecycle admission controller is a validating admission plugin that ensures:
a. All resources are created within valid namespaces.
b. Prevents creation of resources in non-existent or terminating namespaces.
c. Handles automatic deletion of all resources within a namespace when that namespace is deleted (namespace finalization process).


2. 🚀 What is LimitRanger?
-> The LimitRanger admission controller enforces resource usage constraints (like CPU & memory limits) on Pods and Containers at the time of creation.
-> It ensures that Pods comply with resource limits/requests defined in the namespace using a LimitRange object.
-> Helps prevent resource abuse and ensures fair usage among tenants in a cluster.
🎯 Main Functions of LimitRanger
Feature						Description
Default resource requests/limits	Auto-assigns default CPU/memory if not specified.
Max/min resource enforcement		Prevents Pods that exceed max/min thresholds.
Enforces ratio constraints		Controls request/limit ratios to ensure balance.
Applies to namespace-scoped resources	Works within individual namespaces.


3. 🚀 What is ServiceAccount Admission Controller?
-> The ServiceAccount admission controller automatically manages ServiceAccounts for Pods and injects tokens needed to authenticate to the Kubernetes API.

🎯 Main Responsibilities:
-- Automatically assigns a ServiceAccount to a Pod if one is not specified.
-- Mounts the ServiceAccount token into the Pod so it can interact with the API securely.
-- Ensures Pods are linked to Kubernetes RBAC permissions via their ServiceAccount.

⚙️ By Default (Out-of-the-box Kubernetes cluster):
-> The default service account has no permissions to access the Kubernetes API — unless you explicitly assign them using RoleBinding or ClusterRoleBinding.
It cannot list, get, create, delete, or modify resources.

✅ Best Practices with ServiceAccount Controller
1. Use custom ServiceAccounts for Pods that need API access.
2. Bind minimal RBAC roles to those ServiceAccounts — Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP).
3. Disable automounting when unnecessary:
$$ automountServiceAccountToken: false
4. Avoid using the default SA for sensitive workloads — create namespace-specific ServiceAccounts.
5. Rotate ServiceAccount tokens periodically (Kubernetes handles this automatically in newer versions).


4. 🚀 What is the NodeRestriction Admission Controller?
-> The NodeRestriction admission controller is a validating admission plugin that limits the actions that kubelets (nodes) can perform when interacting with the Kubernetes API on behalf of themselves.
🔑 What Can Nodes Do with NodeRestriction Enabled?
		Action				Allowed?
Modify its own Node object (status updates)	✅ Yes
Modify Pods scheduled on itself			✅ Yes (status updates, heartbeats)
Read Secrets/ConfigMaps referenced by its Pods	✅ Yes (if bound via PodSpec)
Create CSRs for its own identity		✅ Yes
Access other nodes' Pods or modify them		❌ No
Modify other Node objects			❌ No


5. 🚀 What is the PodSecurity Admission Controller?
-> The PodSecurity Admission (PSA) controller is a built-in Kubernetes admission controller that enforces Pod Security Standards (PSS) at the namespace level.

🔐 Purpose:
-- Ensure Pods comply with security best practices (e.g., no privileged containers, restricted host access).
-- Prevent Pods from using insecure configurations before they're created.

📊 PodSecurity vs PodSecurityPolicy (PSP)
Feature		PodSecurity (PSA)		PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) (Deprecated)
Admission type	Built-in Admission Controller	Built-in Admission Controller (deprecated)
Granularity	Namespace level (via labels)	Cluster-wide policies
Ease of use	Simple and declarative		Complex, required detailed RBAC
Modes		Enforce, Audit, Warn		Only Enforce
Kubernetes version	GA in 1.25+		Removed in 1.25


6. 🚀 What is the ResourceQuota Admission Controller?
-> The ResourceQuota Admission Controller is a built-in Kubernetes admission plugin that enforces resource usage limits in a namespace.
-> It prevents users from exceeding defined quotas for resources like CPU, memory, and number of objects (e.g., Pods, Services).

⚙️ How Does ResourceQuota Admission Controller Work?
ResourceQuota object is defined per namespace.
When a user creates or modifies a resource (like Pod, PVC):
Admission controller intercepts the request.
Checks current usage + requested amount against quota.
If exceeds quota, the request is rejected with an error.

🛡️ Why Use ResourceQuota?
Benefit				Description
Fair resource sharing		Prevent "noisy neighbors" from hogging resources.
Multi-tenancy enforcement	Divide cluster resources among teams/projects.
Cost and capacity control	Predict and manage usage, aiding capacity planning.
Prevents resource exhaustion	Stops cluster-wide outages caused by overuse.

🧠 Difference Between ResourceQuota & LimitRange
Feature		ResourceQuota			LimitRange
Scope	Namespace-wide resource limits	Default/min/max for individual Pods/containers
Type	Aggregate control		Per-resource request/limit control
Purpose	Prevent namespace overuse	Set default/fair container sizing
✅ Best together: Use LimitRange to set default Pod sizes, and ResourceQuota to control total usage.


7. 🚀 What is the DefaultStorageClass Admission Controller?
-> DefaultStorageClass Admission Controller is a built-in Kubernetes admission plugin.
-> Purpose:
   -- Automatically assign the default StorageClass to a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) if the user doesn't specify any storageClassName.
   -- Helps in automatic provisioning of storage without requiring users to know the available StorageClasses.

⚙️ How Does It Work?
1. Admin creates and marks a StorageClass as default.
2. User creates a PVC without storageClassName.
3. DefaultStorageClass admission controller:
   -- Intercepts PVC creation.
   -- Injects the default StorageClass name into the PVC.
4. PVC is dynamically provisioned using the default StorageClass.

🛡️ Why Use DefaultStorageClass Admission Controller?
Benefit				Description
Simplifies storage provisioning	Users don't need to specify storage classes manually.
Enforces consistency		Ensures all PVCs get a StorageClass if none is provided.
Enables dynamic provisioning	Ensures PVCs can trigger automatic PersistentVolume creation.
Reduces user errors		Prevents failed PVC creation due to missing storage class.



8. 🚀 What is the MutatingAdmissionWebhook Admission Controller?
-> The MutatingAdmissionWebhook is a Kubernetes admission controller that allows dynamic modification (mutation) of Kubernetes API objects at the time of their creation or modification.
-> It enables custom logic to intercept API requests and modify them before they are persisted into etcd (the Kubernetes data store).

⚙️ How Does It Work?
Flow:
User submits API request (e.g., create Pod).
Admission control phase is triggered.
MutatingAdmissionWebhook sends the request object to registered webhooks.
Webhook examines and optionally modifies the object.
Modified object is returned to API server.
Final object is persisted into etcd and deployed.

💡 Why Use MutatingAdmissionWebhook?
Benefit				Description
Automatic defaults injection	Add default values like labels, annotations, tolerations.
Sidecar injection		Add additional containers (e.g., for monitoring, security) to Pods.
Security and compliance		Enforce security contexts, limit capabilities, inject secrets.
Cross-cutting concerns		Inject configurations (e.g., logging agents, service mesh proxies).
Infrastructure consistency	Enforce organizational policies dynamically.


9. 🚀 What is the ValidatingAdmissionWebhook Admission Controller?
-> ValidatingAdmissionWebhook is a Kubernetes admission controller that allows custom validation of Kubernetes API requests.
-> It lets you define webhooks that accept or reject requests based on custom logic without modifying the object.
-> Runs after any MutatingAdmissionWebhook (if configured).
⚙️ How Does It Work?
Request Flow:
User submits API request (e.g., create Pod).
Kubernetes API server invokes MutatingAdmissionWebhook (if enabled).
After mutation, API server calls ValidatingAdmissionWebhook.
Webhook evaluates the object and returns "allow" or "deny" decision.
If allowed, object is persisted and deployed; if denied, user gets error message.

🎯 Purpose of ValidatingAdmissionWebhook
Goal				Description
Enforce policies	Prevent insecure configurations (e.g., privileged Pods).
Governance and compliance	Ensure all workloads comply with organizational policies.
Prevent invalid configs	Deny deployments with invalid resource requests, labels, etc.
Security enforcement	Block usage of disallowed images, privilege escalations.
