âœ… 1. Integrating OPA/Gatekeeper for Policy Enforcement
ðŸ“Œ What is OPA/Gatekeeper?
-> OPA (Open Policy Agent) is a policy engine to enforce fine-grained policies (security, compliance, best practices) in K8s.
-> Gatekeeper is an OPA controller for Kubernetes â€” it allows admission control using OPA policies (Rego).

ðŸŽ¯ What kind of policies can be enforced?
-- Disallow privileged pods.
-- Block containers running without resource limits.
-- Enforce labeling/naming standards.
-- Prevent hostPath mounts or usage of hostNetwork.

ðŸ”‘ Basic Setup Steps:
1. Install Gatekeeper:
$$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper/master/deploy/gatekeeper.yaml
