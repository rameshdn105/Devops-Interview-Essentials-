Q. what is pdb in k8? PodDisruptionBudget
-> A PodDisruptionBudget (PDB) defines the number of replicas of a pod that must be available at any given time for 
   some reason such as upgrades or routine maintenance work on the Kubernetes nodes.
-> PDB (PodDisruptionBudget) to ensure that your pods are not terminated or evicted unless it's absolutely necessary. 
-> ECK manages a default PDB per Elasticsearch resource.

** A Pod Disruption Budget (PDB) ensures that a minimum number of pods remain available during voluntary disruptions like:
-- Node maintenance/drain (e.g., kubectl drain)
-- Rolling updates
-- Cluster upgrades
-- Pod eviction during deployments or scaling events.
-> PDB prevents too many pods from being evicted simultaneously, ensuring high availability of critical applications.

⚠️ Note:
-> PDB does NOT protect against involuntary disruptions (e.g., node crashes, out-of-memory kills).

⚙️ PDB Configuration Options:
1. minAvailable: Minimum number of pods that must be available (absolute number or percentage).
2. maxUnavailable: Maximum number of pods that can be unavailable (absolute number or percentage).
-> You can use either minAvailable or maxUnavailable, but not both at the same time.

🚦 When PDB is Triggered:
-> During kubectl drain, if PDB constraints are violated, Kubernetes will block eviction.
-> Kubernetes respects PDB during rolling updates, ensuring desired availability.

✅ Key Takeaways:
-> Use PDB for critical workloads that require high uptime.
-> Define minAvailable or maxUnavailable based on your app's redundancy.
-> Helps maintain business continuity during cluster operations.
