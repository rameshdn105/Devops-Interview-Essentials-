🔑 What are QoS Classes?
-> Quality of Service (QoS) Classes define pod priority under resource pressure (e.g., CPU, memory contention). [Node experiencing Node Pressure.]
-> Kubernetes uses QoS to decide which pods to evict first during node pressure.

⚙️ Types of QoS Classes:
1. Guaranteed: Best guarantee; most preferred; won't evict easily. Requires CPU and memory requests equal to limits, defined for all containers.
-> Pods that are Guaranteed have the strictest resource limits and are least likely to face eviction. 
-> They are guaranteed not to be killed until they exceed their limits or there are no lower-priority Pods that can be preempted from the Node. 
-> They may not acquire resources beyond their specified limits. 
-> These Pods can also make use of exclusive CPUs using the static CPU management policy.

Criteria:
-> For a Pod to be given a QoS class of Guaranteed:
-- Every Container in the Pod must have a memory limit and a memory request.
-- For every Container in the Pod, the memory limit must equal the memory request.
-- Every Container in the Pod must have a CPU limit and a CPU request.
-- For every Container in the Pod, the CPU limit must equal the CPU request.

** Explanation: Since "requests == limits" for both CPU and memory, Kubernetes marks this pod as Guaranteed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Burstable: Partial guarantee; flexible. Happens when requests are less than limits, or some containers have incomplete resource specs.

Criteria
-> A Pod is given a QoS class of Burstable if:
-- The Pod does not meet the criteria for QoS class Guaranteed.
-- At least one Container in the Pod has a memory or CPU request or limit.

** Explanation: Requests < Limits

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. BestEffort: Lowest priority; evicted first under resource pressure. No resource requests or limits defined.
-> For example, if you have a node with 16 CPU cores available to the kubelet, and you assign 4 CPU cores to a Guaranteed Pod, then a Pod in the BestEffort QoS class can try to use any amount of the remaining 12 CPU cores.

-> The kubelet prefers to evict BestEffort Pods if the node comes under resource pressure.

Criteria
-- A Pod has a QoS class of BestEffort if it doesn't meet the criteria for either  Guaranteed or Burstable. 
-- In other words, a Pod is BestEffort only if none of the Containers in the Pod have a memory limit or a memory request, and none of the Containers in the Pod have a CPU limit or a CPU request. 
-- Containers in a Pod can request other resources (not CPU or memory) and still be classified as BestEffort.

** Explanation: No resources specified — lowest priority, evicted first under node pressure.

✅ Why QoS Class is important for HA?
Scenario				                Eviction Order
1. Node under Memory/CPU pressure	BestEffort pods evicted first, then Burstable, Guaranteed last
2. Pod survival under resource limits	Guaranteed pods stay longest, ensuring app uptime


✅ Check Pod QoS Class:
kubectl get pod <pod-name> -o jsonpath='{.status.qosClass}'


⚙️ Best Practices for Scheduling & HA
✅ Use PDBs for all critical apps to avoid downtime during maintenance.
✅ Set appropriate QoS Classes via requests & limits for all pods:
-- Use Guaranteed for critical apps (e.g., databases, ingress).
-- Use Burstable/BestEffort for non-critical/batch jobs.
✅ Combine Node Affinity and PodAntiAffinity to spread pods across nodes for better HA.
✅ Monitor PDB violations using kubectl describe pdb.
✅ Use HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA) with PDB to handle load spikes safely.
