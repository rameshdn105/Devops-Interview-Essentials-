✅ Advanced Strategies (via other tools like ArgoCD/Flux/CD tools)
-> Although Kubernetes natively supports RollingUpdate and Recreate, advanced strategies like Blue-Green Deployments and Canary Deployments can be achieved using:
1. Argo Rollouts
2. Flagger
3. Service Mesh (e.g., Istio)

✅ Istio/Service Mesh: (managing microservices)
-----------------------------------------------
💡 Istio is an open-source service mesh that provides a dedicated infrastructure layer for managing service-to-service communication within a Kubernetes cluster (or across multiple clusters).
-> It provides a set of features for managing and securing microservices applications. 
-> It is built on top of the Kubernetes platform and is designed to work seamlessly with it.

✅ Key Responsibilities of Istio:
1. Traffic Management — Fine-grained control of traffic routing (e.g., canary deployments, blue-green, A/B testing), Routing rules (path, headers, version-based), Retries, timeouts, fault injection, Load balancing, mirroring (traffic shadowing).
2. Observability — Telemetry, tracing, and monitoring of service communication.
-- Metrics via Prometheus, dashboards in Grafana
-- Distributed tracing via Jaeger or Zipkin, Access logs.
3. Security — Automatic, mTLS (Mutual TLS), RBAC  [authentication, authorization], and traffic encryption, Identity and credential management.
4. Policy Enforcement — Rate limiting, quotas, and access controls, External authorization integrations.
5. Resiliency — Fault injection, retries, circuit breaking, timeouts.

✅ How Does Istio Work?
-> Istio uses a sidecar proxy pattern to manage communication between microservices. 
-> It automatically injects a sidecar proxy (Envoy) alongside each application Pod.

⚙️ Architecture Overview:
1. Control Plane (Istiod):
-> Handles configuration and management of the proxies.
-> Manages certificates for mTLS.
-> Distributes policies and traffic management rules.

2. Data Plane (Envoy Proxies):
-> Sidecar proxies injected into each Pod.
-> Intercept and manage all inbound and outbound traffic.
-> Enforce security, collect telemetry, and apply traffic rules.

✅ Core Istio Components:
Component			Purpose
Istiod		Control plane — configuration, policy distribution, certificate authority.
Envoy Proxy	Sidecar data plane proxy for traffic interception and control.
Ingress Gateway	Manage inbound traffic to services.
Egress Gateway	Manage outbound traffic to external services.
Mixer (deprecated)	Policy and telemetry (older Istio versions).
