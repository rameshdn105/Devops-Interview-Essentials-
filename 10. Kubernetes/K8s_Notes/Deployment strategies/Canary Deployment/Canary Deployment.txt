Canary Deployment:
---------------------
ðŸ’¡ Canary Deployment is a gradual rollout strategy where the new version is released to a small subset of users first. If it works fine, it is gradually rolled out to more users, and eventually to everyone.

âœ… How Canary Deployment Works:
1. New version (canary) is deployed alongside existing version.
2. A small percentage of traffic (e.g., 5%) is routed to canary.
3. Monitor metrics (errors, latency).
4. If everything is fine, increase traffic gradually (e.g., 25%, 50%, 100%).
5. If problems are detected, rollback quickly with minimal user impact.

âœ… Key Benefits of Canary:
-- Low risk â€” limits impact if thereâ€™s a bug.
-- Gradual rollout with real traffic exposure.
-- Safe testing in production without affecting all users.

Step 1: 
90% traffic --> v1 (Stable)
10% traffic --> v2 (Canary)

Step 2 (if OK):
50% --> v1
50% --> v2

Step 3 (Fully rolled out):
100% --> v2
