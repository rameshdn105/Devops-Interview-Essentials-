Blue-Green Deployment:
-------------------------
ðŸ’¡ Blue-Green Deployment is a strategy where two identical environments (Blue and Green) are maintained â€” one is live (production) and one is staging/testing.
-> When a new version is ready, it is deployed to the Green environment and traffic is switched to Green once verified.

âœ… How Blue-Green Deployment Works:
1. Blue environment: Active production environment serving users.
2. Green environment: New version is deployed and tested without affecting live users.
3. After testing, switch traffic from Blue to Green.
4. If issues occur, rollback is easy â€” switch traffic back to Blue.

âœ… Key Benefits of Blue-Green:
-- Zero downtime (if properly designed).
-- Easy rollback by switching back to Blue.
-- Full testing in real production-like environment before going live.

Step 1: 
Live Traffic --> Blue (v1) [Live]

Step 2: 
Deploy v2 to Green, test it

Step 3:
Switch Traffic --> Green (v2) [Live]

If failed:
Switch back Traffic --> Blue (v1)
