StatefulSet:
----------------
-> A StatefulSet in Kubernetes is a specialized type of Deployment designed for managing stateful applications. 
-> While Deployments are great for stateless applications, StatefulSets are tailored for applications that need to maintain persistent state across Pods, like databases, message queues, or any application where the identity and storage must be preserved even if the Pod is restarted, rescheduled, or moved to another node.
	  
✅ It creates the Stateful application:
✅ For the StatefulSets to work, a headless service should be created. 
✅ Also StatefulSets need persistent data storage, so that the application saves the data and states across the restarts. 	 
✅ StatefulSets are recommended when running Cassandra, MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL or any other workload utilizing persistent storage. 
✅ They can help maintain state during scaling and update events, and are particularly useful for maintaining high availability.	   

Key Characteristics of StatefulSets:
-------------------------------------
1. Stable Network Identity: Each Pod in a StatefulSet gets a unique, stable network identity that persists across rescheduling or restarts.
-- Pods in a StatefulSet are named in a predictable pattern, typically using the name of the StatefulSet followed by an index number, like my-app-0, my-app-1, my-app-2, etc.

2. StatefulSets are usually paired with Persistent Volumes (PVs) to provide persistent storage for each Pod. Each Pod in a StatefulSet gets its own PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC), which ensures that data is not lost when a Pod is deleted or recreated.

3. Ordered Pod Deployment and Scaling: StatefulSets ensure that Pods are created, updated, or deleted in a specific order. For example, Pods are deployed in ascending order (Pod-0, Pod-1, etc.), and the scaling operations (scaling up or down) also happen in an ordered manner.

4. Graceful Termination: Pods in a StatefulSet are terminated in reverse order (from the highest index down to 0), allowing for a more graceful shutdown and recovery. This ensures that Pods are cleaned up systematically and in the correct order.

5. Pod Management: In contrast to a Deployment, which can replace Pods at random, a StatefulSet ensures that Pods are replaced in a controlled manner, preserving the stateful application behavior.

6. Stable Storage: StatefulSets create and manage PersistentVolumeClaims for each Pod, which provides storage that survives Pod restarts and reschedules.

Stateful Applications:
----------------------
-> It is an API-object that’s purpose-built to support stateful application components. 
-> It creates a set of identically configured Pods from a spec you supply, but each Pod is assigned a non-interchangeable identity. 
-> Pods retain their identity if they have to be rescheduled or you scale the StatefulSet.
-> StatefulSets solve the challenges of running stateful services in Kubernetes. 
-> The persistent Pod identities permit storage volumes to be associated with specific Pods inside the StatefulSet. 
-> They also facilitate graceful scaling operations and rolling updates, where Pods are added and removed in a predictable order.

When to Use StatefulSets?
--------------------------
-> Let’s consider a simple example of running three replicas of a MySQL database server in Kubernetes. 
-> The deployment should be configured with one Pod in the primary role, handling read-write operations, and the remaining three Pods as MySQL read-only replicas.

-> Applications connecting to the database will always need to connect to the Pod that’s in the primary role in order to receive read-write access. This wouldn’t be possible if a Deployment or ReplicaSet was used, as scheduling or replication changes would generate new Pod identities. The application would have no way of knowing which Pod is the primary MySQL instance.

-> StatefulSets eliminate this problem. Each Pod in the StatefulSet is assigned a predictable and consistent network identity in the form <statefulset-name>-<pod-ordinal-index>. The four Pods in the MySQL deployment would be named as follows:

mysql-0 – First Pod, in the primary role
mysql-1 – Read-only replica
mysql-2 – Read-only replica

-> Now other applications can connect to mysql-0 to reliably interact with the MySQL primary instance. Because StatefulSets also guarantee ordered updates, the vital mysql-0 replica is only terminated if you scale down to zero. The read-only replicas will always be removed first.

-> Furthermore, the persistent storage characteristics of StatefulSets mean that each Pod will always have its own storage volume reattached, even after it’s rescheduled. Each replica, therefore, maintains its own copy of the database, ensuring reliable, independent data replication.

-> Similarly, Pods support stable network identities using a headless service that you must separately create.
