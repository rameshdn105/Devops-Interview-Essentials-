-> Secret is used to store sensitive data (like passwords, tokens, API keys) in base64-encoded form.
-> Kubernetes secrets are base64-encoded, but not fully encrypted by default (can be encrypted at rest with proper setup).


ðŸ”‘ Use-cases:
-- Storing credentials, tokens, keys.
-- TLS certificates, database passwords.

âœ… Base64 Encoding for Secrets
echo -n 'Ramesh' | base64
# Output: UmFtZXNo

echo -n 'password' | base64
# Output: cGFzc3dvcmQ=

To decode back:
echo 'UmFtZXNo' | base64 --decode
