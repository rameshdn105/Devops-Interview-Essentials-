✅ CSI (Container Storage Interface) Driver:
---------------------------------------------

-> CSI is an industry-standard interface developed to decouple Kubernetes from specific storage vendors. 
-> It allows Kubernetes (and other orchestrators) to use storage solutions without needing custom code for each vendor in Kubernetes core.

🔑 Goal: Provide a standard mechanism for storage vendors to expose storage systems to containerized workloads.

✅ CSI Advanced Features
1. Snapshots: Take backup/copy of volume at a point in time
2. Cloning: Create an exact copy of an existing volume
3. Resizing: Expand volume size on-the-fly
4. Ephemeral Volumes: Pod-specific temporary volumes
5. Secrets Injection (Secrets Store CSI): Mount external secrets directly into pods
6. Volume Health Monitoring: Monitor and report storage issues

5. Secrets Injection (Secrets Store CSI): Mount external secrets directly into pods
-> Secrets Store CSI (Container Storage Interface) Driver

✅ Why CSI Was Introduced?
  Issue with Old In-Tree Plugins		    Solution via CSI Driver
Storage drivers built inside Kubernetes code	Out-of-tree (external) CSI plugins
Hard to add/update storage backends		Add new CSI driver without touching K8s
Kubernetes release needed for storage updates	CSI driver updates independent of K8s
Limited lifecycle operations (snapshots, resize)    CSI supports full lifecycle, including snapshots, cloning, resizing
Security and maintenance complexity		Separate and isolated deployment

✅ Key Components of CSI Architecture
  Component				Role
CSI Driver (Plugin)	Talks to the actual storage backend (e.g., AWS EBS, Azure Disk)
External-Provisioner	Watches PVCs and triggers volume provisioning
External-Attacher	Handles attaching/detaching volumes to/from nodes
External-Resizer	Handles dynamic volume resizing
External-Snapshotter	Manages snapshot lifecycle (create/delete snapshots)
Node Plugin		Mount/unmount volumes to running pods on nodes
Controller Plugin	Handles provisioning, attaching volumes (runs as StatefulSet/Deployment)


✅ How CSI Driver Works (End-to-End Flow)
Example flow when a Pod requests a volume:
User --> PVC --> StorageClass --> CSI Provisioner --> Storage Backend
                                          ↳ (e.g., AWS EBS, Azure Disk)

-> Step-by-Step Flow:
1. User creates PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim).
2. Kubernetes/PVC looks at the StorageClass, identifies CSI provisioner.
3. CSI Provisioner calls the backend storage API to create a volume.
4. PV (PersistentVolume) gets created and bound to the PVC.
5. External-Attacher attaches the volume to the node where Pod runs.
6. Node Plugin mounts the volume inside the pod.


✅ CSI Driver Operations (with API Mappings)
1. Create Volume - CSI API: CreateVolume - Creates a persistent storage volume.
2. Delete Volume - CSI API: DeleteVolume - Deletes a persistent storage volume.
3. Attach/Detach Volume - CSI APIs: ControllerPublishVolume / ControllerUnpublishVolume - 4. Attaches or detaches a volume to/from a node.
5. Mount/Unmount Volume - CSI APIs: NodePublishVolume / NodeUnpublishVolume - Mounts or unmounts a volume on the node.
6. Snapshot Creation/Restore - CSI APIs: CreateSnapshot, DeleteSnapshot, ListSnapshots - 7. Creates, deletes, or lists snapshots of a volume.
8. Clone Volume - CSI API: CreateVolume with VolumeContentSource - Creates a new volume from an existing volume (clone operation).
9. Resize Volume - CSI APIs: ControllerExpandVolume, NodeExpandVolume - Dynamically increases the volume size (expansion).



✅ Typical CSI Driver Deployment Architecture
1. Controller Pods (Deployment or StatefulSet)
-> Handles volume provisioning and attachment.

2. Node Pods (DaemonSet)
-> Handles volume mount/unmount on nodes.

k get pods -n kube-system
NAME                                  READY   STATUS
csi-aws-node-xxxxx                    3/3     Running  # Node plugin
csi-aws-controller-xxxx               2/2     Running  # Controller plugin
external-snapshotter-xxxx             1/1     Running  # Snapshot manager


✅ Flow of Dynamic PV Provisioning using StorageClass + CSI:
1. User creates a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)
        │
        ▼
2. Kubernetes looks up the StorageClass attached to PVC
        │
        ▼
3. StorageClass has provisioner field (e.g., ebs.csi.aws.com)
        │
        ▼
4. CSI plugin (driver) gets triggered to create an actual volume on cloud/storage backend
        │
        ▼
5. CSI plugin provisions volume, returns PV to Kubernetes
        │
        ▼
6. Pod can now use PVC (backed by PV)
