-> This is known as ‚ÄúThe 4Cs Security Model‚Äù: Cloud, Cluster, Container, Code. 
-> Addressing all these layers ensures comprehensive security coverage from development to deployment. 
-> The best practices for Kubernetes security can also be classified into these four categories of the cloud-native approach.

Best Practices for Securing Kubernetes Clusters:
================================================
1. Keep Kubernetes and Components Updated: Regularly apply security patches and updates.
2. Use Network Policies: Restrict traffic between Pods and namespaces.
3. Enable RBAC: Implement fine-grained access control.
4. Use Pod Security Standards: Enforce security standards on Pods using the PodSecurity admission controller.
5. Enable Audit Logs: Track and monitor API activity with audit logs.
6. Use Secrets Management: Encrypt secrets and avoid hardcoding sensitive information.
7. Monitor and Alert: Implement monitoring and alerting for unusual behavior (e.g., unauthorized access or privilege escalation).
8. Limit Privileges: Run containers with the least privileges necessary and disable unnecessary capabilities.
9. Protect Nodes in Kubernetes
10. Reduce container attack surface
11. Scan for vulnerabilities




-> Nodes are the backbone of your Kubernetes cluster, and securing them is crucial to prevent attacks, unauthorized access, and data breaches. Here‚Äôs how you can protect your nodes effectively:


====================================================================================================

üîê Limiting privileges in Kubernetes (K8s) is a critical part of hardening your cluster and reducing the blast radius in case of compromise. By applying least privilege principles, you ensure that workloads, users, and components only have access to what they truly need ‚Äî nothing more.

üö® Why Limit Privileges in Kubernetes?
Problem					                            Solution
Over-permissioned service accounts	  Use RBAC to assign only necessary roles
Containers running as root		        Use Pod Security Standards (PSS) or PSA to enforce non-root containers
Host path mounts exposing sensitive data	Restrict volumes and mounts
Broad network access between pods	    Enforce Network Policies
Excessive Kubernetes API access		    Fine-grained RBAC policies


‚úÖ Key Techniques to Limit Privileges in Kubernetes
1. Use RBAC to Control API Access (Role, ClusterRole, RoleBinding)
2. Use Pod Security Standards (PSS) to Enforce Pod-Level Restrictions
3. Use Network Policies to Limit Pod-to-Pod and Pod-to-Internet Traffic

4. Avoid Privileged Containers & Escalated Rights
-> Do not run as privileged unless absolutely necessary.
-> Use securityContext to drop unnecessary Linux capabilities.
Example: Drop all capabilities, non-root
securityContext:
  runAsNonRoot: true
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  capabilities:
    drop: ["ALL"]

5. Restrict Service Account Tokens (Prevent API Abuse)
-> Do not auto-mount service account tokens unless needed.
-> Example: Prevent mounting of service account tokens
automountServiceAccountToken: false

6. Minimize Host Path and Host Network Usage
-> Avoid hostPath volumes unless needed for specific cases.
-> Avoid hostNetwork, hostPID, hostIPC unless explicitly needed
-> Example: Avoid this unless mandatory:
volumes:
- name: host-volume
  hostPath:
    path: /etc
    type: Directory

7. Limit Sensitive Volume Mounts and Environment Variables [Secrets, ConfigMaps]
8. Apply Admission Controllers to Enforce Policies



‚öôÔ∏è Bonus: Tools to Audit and Enforce Least Privilege
Tool			            Purpose
OPA/Gatekeeper	Policy-as-Code enforcement for Kubernetes
Kyverno		    Kubernetes-native policy engine (easier than OPA)
Kube-bench	  CIS Benchmark checks (RBAC, Pod Security, etc.)
Kubesec		    Scan YAML manifests for security issues
Trivy / Kube-hunter	Container image and K8s cluster vulnerability scans


‚úÖ Summary: Kubernetes Least Privilege Checklist
1. API access (RBAC): Fine-grained Role/ClusterRole with RoleBinding
2. Pod privilege :PodSecurity: restricted profile
3. Network communication :NetworkPolicy to control traffic
4. Run containers as non-root	runAsNonRoot: true, drop capabilities
5. Avoid service account tokens: automountServiceAccountToken: false
6. Host resources: Avoid hostPath, hostNetwork, hostPID
7. Volume and secret usage: Minimal exposure, only where needed
8. Admission controllers: Use PodSecurity, NodeRestriction, Webhooks
9. Regular audits: Use tools like Kyverno, Gatekeeper, kube-bench
