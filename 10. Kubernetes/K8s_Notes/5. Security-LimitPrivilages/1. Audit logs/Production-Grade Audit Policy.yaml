# (Balanced for Security & Performance)
# ‚öôÔ∏è Goal: Capture all sensitive actions (create/update/delete), log metadata for reads (get/list/watch), avoid flooding logs with system noise.

apiVersion: audit.k8s.io/v1
kind: Policy
rules:
  # Log all critical changes with full request/response data
  - level: RequestResponse

  # Log secrets and configmaps access

  # Log all "get", "list", "watch" as metadata (avoid excessive size)

  # System components like kube-proxy (skip noisy system requests)

# üö® Purpose:
# Full logs of resource modifications.
# Metadata of read actions for visibility without log bloat.
# Ignore system noise from kube-proxy and kubelet health checks.
