🚀 What is a NetworkPolicy in Kubernetes?
-> A NetworkPolicy is a Kubernetes resource that controls how pods are allowed to communicate with each other and with other network endpoints (e.g., external IPs).

👉 It restricts or allows:
1. Pod-to-pod communication
2. Pod-to-external communication
3. External-to-pod communication
⚠️ By default, all pods can communicate with all other pods unless a NetworkPolicy restricts that.


✅ Why Use NetworkPolicy?
-> Restrict internal pod communication (e.g., only allow frontend to talk to backend).
-> Secure sensitive services (e.g., databases only accessible to specific apps).
-> Control egress traffic (e.g., only allow pods to connect to specific IPs or domains).

🔑 Key Components of a NetworkPolicy
Field			        Purpose
podSelector 	Selects the pods to which this policy applies
policyTypes 	Whether it controls Ingress, Egress, or both
ingress		    Rules for incoming traffic
egress		    Rules for outgoing traffic
namespaceSelector	Selects pods in other namespaces
ipBlock		    CIDR ranges to allow/deny


✅ Basic Example: Allow traffic to specific pods (Ingress)
-> Applies to pods labeled role: backend in app namespace.
-> Only allows incoming traffic from pods labeled role: frontend.
-> Only on TCP port 80.

✅ Deny all traffic (default deny)
➡️ This blocks all incoming traffic to pods in the app namespace unless explicitly allowed by other NetworkPolicies.

✅ Example: Allow egress traffic only to specific CIDR
➡️ Backend pods can only access IPs in 192.168.1.0/24 on TCP port 443 (e.g., HTTPS).


🔑 Important Notes on NetworkPolicies:
Aspect			Explanation
Default behavior	No isolation; all pods can talk to each other
Effect of first policy	Once any NetworkPolicy applies to a pod, all traffic is denied unless explicitly allowed
Isolation applies	To pods selected by podSelector
Policy scope		Namespace-scoped (only affects pods in same namespace unless namespaceSelector is used)


🔐 Best Practices for NetworkPolicies:
1. Start with "default deny" policies for both ingress and egress.
2. Explicitly allow only the necessary traffic (least privilege).
3. Use labels effectively to group and select pods for policies.
4. Regularly review and update policies as your architecture evolves.
5. Test policies to avoid accidentally breaking communication between essential services.


✅ Command to Check NetworkPolicies
$$ kubectl get networkpolicies -n <namespace>
$$ kubectl describe networkpolicy <policy-name> -n <namespace>
