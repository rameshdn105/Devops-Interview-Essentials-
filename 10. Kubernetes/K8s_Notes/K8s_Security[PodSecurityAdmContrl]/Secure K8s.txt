-> This is known as “The 4Cs Security Model”: Cloud, Cluster, Container, Code. 
-> Addressing all these layers ensures comprehensive security coverage from development to deployment. 
-> The best practices for Kubernetes security can also be classified into these four categories of the cloud-native approach.



Best Practices for Securing Kubernetes Clusters:
================================================
1. Keep Kubernetes and Components Updated: Regularly apply security patches and updates.
2. Use Network Policies: Restrict traffic between Pods and namespaces.
3. Enable RBAC: Implement fine-grained access control.
4. Use Pod Security Standards: Enforce security standards on Pods using the PodSecurity admission controller.
5. Enable Audit Logs: Track and monitor API activity with audit logs.
6. Use Secrets Management: Encrypt secrets and avoid hardcoding sensitive information.
7. Monitor and Alert: Implement monitoring and alerting for unusual behavior (e.g., unauthorized access or privilege escalation).
8. Limit Privileges: Run containers with the least privileges necessary and disable unnecessary capabilities.





1. Prevent unwanted access to the API server / Controlling access to the API server
2. Kubernetes secrets
3. 
4. Protect nodes
5. Multi-tenancy and workload isolation

9. Evolution of built-in Pod-level security controls

11. Container runtime hardening
12. Use trusted images with proper tags
13. Reduce container attack surface
14. Scan for vulnerabilities
