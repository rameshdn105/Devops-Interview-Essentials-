üîê Secrets Management in Kubernetes is crucial to securely handle sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, tokens, and certificates ‚Äî without exposing them in plain text inside Pods or configuration files.


üöÄ What Are Kubernetes Secrets?
-> Kubernetes Secrets are Kubernetes objects used to store small amounts of sensitive data, such as:
1. Database credentials, Passwords
2. TLS certificates
3. Tokens (e.g., OAuth, service account tokens)
4. Keys [ssh, Auth]
-> Secrets are base64-encoded, not encrypted by default at rest, but Kubernetes offers mechanisms to secure, manage, and control access to them.

‚úÖ Why Use Kubernetes Secrets?
Reason			Description
Secure Storage		Store sensitive data outside of code and container specs.
Controlled Access	Access controlled via RBAC and Service Accounts.
Decouple Secrets from Applications	Manage secrets independently from apps.
Automatic Mounting and Injection	Inject secrets directly into Pods as files or environment variables.

‚öôÔ∏è Types of Secrets
Type		Description
Opaque		Generic key-value pairs (default).
TLS		TLS private key and certificate.
docker-registry	Credentials for Docker registry access.
Service Account Token	Automatically created tokens for service accounts.


‚úÖ Why Secrets Management is Important for Security
Issue to Address			        Kubernetes Secrets Help With
Hardcoding secrets in manifests		Store and reference them securely
Secure distribution of sensitive data	Inject into pods without exposure in spec files
Access control				Combine with RBAC to limit who/what can read
Encryption at rest			Encrypt secrets in etcd using KMS provider


üîë Best Practices for Kubernetes Secrets Management
1. Store Secrets as Kubernetes Secrets Objects
2. Inject Secrets into Pods Securely [As environment variables, As mounted files]
3. Use RBAC to Control Access to Secrets
4. Encrypt Secrets at Rest (Enable Encryption at etcd Layer)
5. Avoid Storing Secrets in Pod Specs or ConfigMaps
6. Rotate Secrets Regularly and Use Short TTL [Periodic rotation of secrets minimizes risk from leaks]
7. Audit Secret Access [Enable Audit Logs to track who accesses Kubernetes secrets, Use RequestResponse level for full tracking.]

üöÄ Advanced Option: Use External Secrets Manager (Dynamic Secrets)
Integrate Kubernetes with tools like:
1. HashiCorp Vault
2. AWS Secrets Manager
3. Azure Key Vault
4. Google Secret Manager
‚û°Ô∏è Tools like External Secrets Operator can sync external secrets to Kubernetes secrets securely and automatically rotate them.
