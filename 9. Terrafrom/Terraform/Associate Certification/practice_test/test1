location in which provider plugins are downloaded to 
    .terraform/provider

2, VCS supported by Terraform cloud 

        github enterprise
        github.com
        bitbucket
        azure repo

3, Terraform is immutable and declarative 

4, how many resources can terraform creates concorrecntly

            10, 
    this setting can be chnaged by adding the configuration block

        terraform {
            parallelism = 20
        }

    above seeting will allow 20 parallel executions 

5, have a look at how to use multiple providers
        using alias

        provider=aws.prod

6, Where does terraform store local statefile for workspaces

        terraform.tfstate.d/<workspace_name>


7, how to set environment variable for passing value to a terraform variable

    environment variable must be in the format TF_VAR_<variable_name>

    eg 
        varibale "demo" {
        type = string
        }
    export TF_VAR_demo="somevalue"
    terraform apply 

8, what are the block types in terraform?

        resource, data, provider, terraform and output

9, platform in which terraform available

        ubuntu. macos, windows, solaris, freebsd

10, what are the commands to download a module

        terraform init and terraform get 

11, configuration for provider specification 

        required_providers (IMP: not - required_provider)

12, use of Terraform show command 

13, locals vs local 

14, why to specify module version ?

16, learn about sentinal and cost estimation in tf cloud 

17, most verbose = TRACE

18, below action will be blocked when statefile is locked

        terraform destroy

19, below action will not be blocked when statefile is locked

        
20, specifying backend config file

        terraform init -backend-config=config.remote.tfbackend

21, what is a backend config file

    # config.remote.tfbackend
workspaces { name = "workspace" }
hostname     = "app.terraform.io"
organization = "company"


22,

following are the key principle of infrastructure as code?
A. Versioned infrastructure
C. Idempotence
D. Self-describing infrastructure


23,

terraform fmt -check -recursive

                
24, lookup and elements functions 

25, variable precedence
