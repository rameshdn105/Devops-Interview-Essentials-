Provisioners are used to execute scripts on local as well as remote machines

types of Provisioners, local-exec, remote-exec, null-resource, file


====>>>> Local-exec

        local-exec provisioners allow us to invoke local executable after resource is created 

example:

    resource "aws_instance" "demo"
    {
        ami = "dsdfcs"
        instance_type = t2.micros
        provisioners "local-exec" {
            command = "echo ${aws_instance.demo.public_ip} >> publlic_ip.txt"
        }
    }

    one of the best use of local-exec is that, you can run ansible playbook on the newly created instances 

    local-exec and invoke the ansible playbook and it can install tools on the newly created resource 





















    ====>>>> remote-exec

    executes scripts on remote machines

for remote exec, you have to use connection block from establishing remote connection with the resource


resource "aws_instance" "demo"
{
    ami = "dsdfcs"
    instance_type = t2.micros
    key_name = myec2_key # same key should be used in provisioners 

    connection {
        type    = "ssh"
        user    = "ec2-user"
        private_key = file(./myec2_key.pem)
        host    = self.public_ip #same resource 
    }
    provisioners "remote-exec" {
        inline = [
            "sudo amazon-linux-extras install nginx1",
            "sudo systemctl start nginx"
        ]
    }
}
