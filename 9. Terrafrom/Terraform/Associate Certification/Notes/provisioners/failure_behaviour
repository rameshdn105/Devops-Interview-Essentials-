    on_failure  = continue == otherwise resource will be marked as tainted 



Failure Behavior
By default, provisioners that fail will also cause the Terraform apply itself to fail. The on_failure setting can be used to 
change this. The allowed values are:

continue - Ignore the error and continue with creation or destruction.

fail - Raise an error and stop applying (the default behavior). If this is a creation provisioner, taint the resource.
