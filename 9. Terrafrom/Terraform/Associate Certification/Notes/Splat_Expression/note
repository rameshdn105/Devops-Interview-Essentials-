A splat expression provides a more concise way to express a common operation that could otherwise be performed with a for expression.



If var.list is a list of objects that all have an attribute id, then a list of the ids could be produced 
with the following for expression:

[for o in var.list : o.id]

This is equivalent to the following splat expression:

var.list[*].id
