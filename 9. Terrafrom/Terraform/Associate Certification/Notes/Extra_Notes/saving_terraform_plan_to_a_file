The below is the command to save the terraform plan output to a file 

terraform plan -out=demopath

plan will be saved to the file called demopath

you can use the saved plan file to run the terraform apply command

        terraform apply demopath


So the main use of saving plan to a file is that - whenever any changes happen to the code by any mistake and you don't want to apply it - you can apply the configuration using the saved plan
