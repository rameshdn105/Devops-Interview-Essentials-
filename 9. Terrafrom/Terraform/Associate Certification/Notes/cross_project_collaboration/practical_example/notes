in this example,

=>  network_project creates an elastic ip and output the ip

=> in security project we will create a security group that whitlist the elastic_ip created by network_project

for referrencing the elastic_ip inside the security_project,

    you need to create a terraform_remote_state date source

    the configuration block is show below,

data "terraform_remote_state" "eip" {
    backend = "s3"
    config = {     
        bucket = "shyam-terraform"
        key    = "network_project/eip.tfstate"
        region = "us-east-1"
    }
}

==> referring to the data source in a terraform config

 cidr_blocks      = ["${data.terraform_remote_state.eip.outputs.eip_id}/32"] 

 here we are using outputs.eip_id

 outputs ==> this is becase we are referring to the outputs block in statefile 

 look at the below statefile,

 {
  "version": 4,
  "terraform_version": "0.15.2",
  "serial": 1,
  "lineage": "408b7746-594a-3928-e3e7-f1260e28dfad",
  "outputs": {       #####################################>>>   we are referring to this output 
    "eip_id": {
      "value": "44.219.3.92",
      "type": "string"
    }
  },
 }
