providers block in a terraform code helps to download the required provider plugin 

example 

        provider aws {
            region ="us-east-2"
        }

        provider azurerm{}


you can have multiple providers in same terraform configuration

provider plugin will be downloaded to .terraform folder 

IMP: for terraform to download provider plugin, you should run 'terraform init' command 


--------------  Provider Maintainers 

    There are mainly 3 types of provider maintainers 

    Official  ->    Owned and Maintained by Hashicorp

    Partner   ->    Owned and maintained by technology company that maintaines direct partnership with hashicorp
                    eg: Alibaba Cloud, Oracle cloud etc..

    Community ->    Owned and maintained by individual contributers



--->    Provider namespace 

        official -> hashicorp

                    Any official provider, that has been release by hashicorp will have the namespace - hashicorp

                    example:
                            hashicorp/aws
                            hashicorp/azurerm
        partner ->  third party organization
                    eg: mongodb/mongodbatlas
                        oracle/oci

        Community -> Individul contributers
                        Devia/gsuite

    Terraform requires explict source information for any provider that are not officially maintained by terraform

    it can be done using a required_provider nested block inside a terraform configuration block

    Syntax:
        terraform{
            required_providers{
                digitalocean = {
                    source = "digitalocean/digitalocean"
                }
            }
        }
        provider "digitalocean"{
            token = "sffsfs"
        }

NOTE: Hashicorp maintainer providers can also be declared inside required_provoder block

example

terraform{
    required_providers{
        aws ={
            source = "hashicorp/aws"
            version = "~> 4.0"
        }
    }
}
provider "aws"{}



It is not mandatory to use required_provider block for Hashicorp mainatained providers, however you can use it if you need to customize things

provider "aws"{
    region = "us-east-1
}

provider azurerm{}
