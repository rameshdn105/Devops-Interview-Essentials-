What if i delete the statefile

When you delete the resource from statefile and resource is present on the cloud

        ANS: terraform plan will show 1 to add but when you run terraform apply, it will throw error saying resource with the same name already exists
        in this case, you have to import the resource to your statefile

when the resource info is present inside statefile, but resource is not present on the cloud

    ANS: plan will show 1 to add and inn the terraform apply, it will create the resource
