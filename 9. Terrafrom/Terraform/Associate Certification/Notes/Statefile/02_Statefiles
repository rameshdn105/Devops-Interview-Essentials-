Terraform state file maps the existing real world resource to the terraform configuration(ie code)
Statefile holds information about the resources present on the provider side (eg aws)

When you destory a resource, the state or entry of the resource details will also be removed from the statefile

NOTE- when you check a statefile for a resource, you can see many other information other than the spec you have provided inside the configuration
    example, IP adrerss, volume data etc..

NOTE: What will happen if you delete a statsfile?
