Desired state and current state

Desired state = the state present in the terraform configuration(ie nothing but whatever configuration present in the terraform code )

current state = the state of infrastructure present on the cloud(or corresponging provider)



IMP NOTE: terraform always try to match the desired state with current state but, it only matches whatever written inside the code

    ie: suppose you create an ec2 instance using terraform and you didn't specify the SG, the ec2 instance will get associated to deafult SG,

            later if you change the deafult SG to a custom SG manually on the console, and if do a terraform refresh, you can see that the statefile
            will change to new custom SG name, beacase terraform always try to match desired state with curernt state. and in your code SG is not specified

                example:

                resource "aws_instance" "example" {
                ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"  # Replace with your desired AMI ID
                instance_type = "t2.micro"
                key_name      = "my-keypair"  # Replace with the name of your existing EC2 key pair
                }
