when a terraform apply is perfomed, terraform automatically lock the statefile.(otherwise, if 2 people perform a terraform apply at 
the same time(for a same resource) statefile will be corrupted)

The statefile locking happens automatically on all operation that could write a state. you won't see any message that it is
 happening


if state lock fails, terraform will not continue 

Not all the backend support state locking 

NOTE: Local backend support state locking 

==>     force unlocking the state locking 

            force-unlock command is used for unlocking 

but if you unlock the state while someone else is performing a write, it could cause multiple writes
