By default s3 doesn't support statefile locking 

You need to make use of DynamoDB for achieveing statelocking 



For using dynamoDb for state locking,

Create a dynamoDb with primary key as LockID(String) , 

in the backend configuration, specify the dynamodb_table,

example,

i created a dynamoDB, terraform_lock, with LockID as the primary key,

backend.tf,

terraform {
    backend "s3" {
        bucket = "terraform-shyam"
        key = "demo/demo.tfstate"
        region = "us-east-1"
        dynamodb_table = "terraform_lock"
    }
}
