how to refer to a module?

    module "example_module" {
        source = ../modules/ec2 #(this is just an example of how to provide the path to module. basically you have to provide the path to module)
        instance_type = t2.micro ## you can pass variable values if it is defined inside the module
    }


IMP:
#using one module output in another module
