The CLI integration brings Terraform Cloud's collaboration features into the familiar Terraform CLI workflow. 
It offers the best of both worlds to developers who are already comfortable with using the Terraform CLI, and it can work 
with existing CI/CD pipelines.

You can start runs with the standard terraform plan and terraform apply commands and then watch the progress of the run from your 
terminal. These runs execute remotely in Terraform Cloud, use variables from the appropriate workspace, enforce any applicable 
Sentinel or OPA policies, and can access Terraform Cloud's private registry and remote state inputs.


basically, you can run the terraform plan and apply from local and it will be executed on the terraform cloud but you will be able to
see the logs on your local terminal
