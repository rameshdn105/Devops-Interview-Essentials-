workspace needs to be created inside a project

while creating a workspace, you have to choose a workflow.

there are mainly 3 workflows

1, vcs driven
2, cli driven
3, api driven

vcs driven -> you need to connect a workspace with a repo.

                it will allow you to run plan and apply, automatically when  a code commit happens

                you can connect a workspace to either root folder of your repo or any other folder

                NOTE: you can connet a workspace with only one folder on a repo,

                if you want to connect a workspace to a specific folder on a repo, in workspace setting, you have to set the working directory to that folder



if you have a folder called sample inside the repo tf_cloud
ie, tf_cloud/sample, and you need to create resources defined inside sample, you need to set the working directory as sample
