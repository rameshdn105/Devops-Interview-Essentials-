VERY IMP NOTE:

    FOR SHARING STATEFILE WITH ANOTHER WORKSPACE, YOU HAVE TO ENABLE Remote state sharing IN YOUR WORKSPACE SETTING

    go to workspace setting -> Remote state sharing -> enable either of these "share with all workspace or share with specific workspace"


main section to note is below,

data "terraform_remote_state" "eip"{
    backend = "remote"
    config = {
        organization = "Terraform_shyam"
        workspaces = {
            name = "networking_project"
        }
    }
}
