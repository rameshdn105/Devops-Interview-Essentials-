It is recommended to keep each module in a seperate repository

Repository name must follow a strict naming convention as below,

        the repo name contains 3 strings seperated by a -
        the repo name should start with the string "terraform" 
        second string should be name of the provider 
        third string should be the module name 

the final repo name will looks like -> terraform-<provider>-<module-name>

example -> terraform-aws-eks

Named terraform-<PROVIDER>-<NAME>. Module repositories must use this three-part name format, where <NAME> reflects the type of infrastructure the module manages and <PROVIDER> is the main provider where it creates that infrastructure. The <NAME> segment can contain additional hyphens. Examples: terraform-google-vault or terraform-aws-ec2-instance.
