Jenkins Multi-Configuration Pipeline Definition and Use Case
A Multi-Configuration Pipeline (also known as Matrix Projects or Multi-Branch Pipeline with Multiple Configurations) in Jenkins allows you to run the same pipeline job across multiple configurations. This is useful when you need to test or build the same project under different conditions, such as multiple operating systems, JDK versions, or other environment variations.

For instance, you may have a project that works in different environments (e.g., Linux, Windows) or with different versions of a tool (e.g., JDK 8, JDK 11). Instead of creating separate Jenkins jobs for each variation, you can define a multi-configuration pipeline to handle multiple configurations in a single job.

Key Concepts
Matrix: In Jenkins, a matrix project allows you to define a set of axes (e.g., OS, JDK version) and run a job for each combination of those axes.
Axes: These are variables that Jenkins uses to determine how to split the job. For example, an axis could be different operating systems (Linux, Windows), or different versions of Java (JDK 8, JDK 11).
Configuration: A configuration is a specific combination of axis values, and Jenkins will run the pipeline with each configuration.
Common Use Cases for Multi-Configuration Pipelines
Cross-platform testing: You can run tests on different operating systems (Linux, Windows, macOS).
Different Java versions: You might want to test your Java application on multiple versions of JDK (e.g., 8, 11, and 14).
Containerization tests: You might want to test your application in different container environments, such as Docker containers with different versions of Node.js or Python.
Browser compatibility: For web applications, you may want to test your app across multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
Example: Multi-Configuration Pipeline for Testing with Different JDK Versions
1. Basic Setup
You can create a Multi-Configuration Pipeline in Jenkins using the Matrix Project Plugin. Here's how you would configure the pipeline:

Install the Matrix Project Plugin: If not already installed, go to Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins > Available and search for Matrix Project Plugin.

Create a Multi-Configuration Job:

In Jenkins, create a new job of type Matrix Project.
Define your axes (e.g., JDK versions, OS).
Matrix Configuration: You would define the configuration matrix within the job’s settings. For example:

Axis 1: JDK versions (e.g., 8, 11)
Axis 2: OS types (e.g., Ubuntu, Windows)
2. Pipeline Example: Testing Java with Different JDK Versions on Multiple Operating Systems
Let’s assume you want to run your Maven-based Java project using JDK 8 and JDK 11 on Ubuntu and Windows.

Job Configuration (Matrix Project):
Axes:
JDK: [8, 11]
OS: [Ubuntu, Windows]
