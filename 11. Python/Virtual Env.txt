o configure your development environment for writing a Python script that uses the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries, you can follow these steps:

Install Python:
Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
Open your command line interface (CLI).
Navigate to your project directory.
Run the following command to create a virtual environment:
python -m venv myenv

Activate the virtual environment:
On Windows:
myenv\Scripts\activate

On macOS and Linux:
source myenv/bin/activate
Install required libraries:
With your virtual environment activated, install the 'requests' and 'BeautifulSoup' libraries using pip:
pip install requests 
pip install beautifulsoup4
Set up your IDE or text editor:
You can use any text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that you prefer (e.g., PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text).
If you're using Visual Studio Code, you can install the Python extension to get features like IntelliSense, linting, debugging, etc.
Write your Python script:
You can now start writing your Python script using the installed libraries.
Example of a simple script that uses requests and BeautifulSoup:
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def main():
    url = 'https://example.com'
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

    print(soup.prettify())  # print formatted HTML of the page

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
Run your script:
Execute your script from the CLI using:
python script_name.py

Ensure that your script runs without errors and performs the intended tasks.
By following these steps, you will have a properly configured environment to develop a Python script that uses the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries for downloading and processing web data.
